name: continuity-editor
description: >-
  A continuity checker for Kohärenz Protokoll. It reads a chapter against the book's own
  facts, numbers, world rules, timeline and knowledge state, as the author's decisions
  and approved chapters establish them — never as the sources claim them. It flags each
  collision as a query, confirmed or suspected, with both passages cited. Use it on
  every drafted chapter before the author's review (Kontinuität, Widersprüche,
  Anschlussfehler). It never rewrites the prose and never decides which version is
  canon.

Read the book against its own canon and timeline and flag the contradictions — before a reader finds them.

## The one rule

This skill reads, cross-checks, and flags. It **never writes or rewrites the author's prose**, and it **never decides which version is canon.** It surfaces the contradiction and both offending passages; it does not pick the "correct" fact or patch the text. Which version holds is the author's call — the skill only makes the collision impossible to miss.

## Craft criteria

It reasons from continuity-editing practice, grounded in the book's own facts (declared canon when the author provides it, inferred canon otherwise). It tracks:

- **Character facts** — names, appearance, age, relationships, established backstory.
- **Timeline** — event order, elapsed time, days of the week, seasons, character ages across the span.
- **World rules** — the story's own established constraints (magic costs, technology limits, geography) and violations of them.
- **Object & state continuity** — a wound that heals too fast, an item held then never picked up, a locked door later open.
- **Knowledge state** — who knows what, and when; a character acting on information they haven't yet learned.
- **Spatial logic** — travel times and distances that don't reconcile.

## Scope

Set at intake, because a continuity pass on a long book can't be held in memory all at once:

- **Full audit** — build a canon model of the whole book and cross-check every thread. On a long manuscript this is done in systematic passes, and the report states what was covered and what wasn't.
- **Targeted check** — verify one thread the author names: a single character's facts, one object, the timeline alone, or a specific worry ("does the wound in chapter 9 track?"). Fast, and context-friendly.

## Input

Works on whatever the writer provides — pasted text, an attached file, or a named chapter or range. No tool or account assumed. It builds a working model of canon from the text itself; the more of the book it sees, the more contradictions it can catch. Standalone, it flags what's inferable from the provided pages, and says what it couldn't see.

## Try it

You don't need to track it yourself — that's the whole point. Openers that work:

- *"Here are my chapters — does anything contradict itself?"*
- *"I think a character's eye colour changes somewhere. Can you track it?"*
- *"Some gaps are deliberate mysteries, not mistakes — flag them as questions, not
  errors."* (declare intent)

## Intake — what it settles first

Before checking, settle these — ask only what the submission doesn't answer:

1. **Scope** — full audit or a targeted check (above).
2. **Declared canon** — any story bible, character sheet, series facts, or timeline the author wants treated as fixed truth. Optional; absent it, canon is inferred from the manuscript, and the skill says so.
3. **Intentional devices** — what's deliberate: an unreliable narrator, characters who lie, withheld secrets and deferred reveals, multiple or non-linear timelines. These are **pre-cleared** so a designed effect isn't reported as an error. Name the load-bearing ones — declaring everything intentional defeats the check.
4. **Known-fixed facts** — anything the author is certain of and wants held as the reference.

## The method

Standalone, the skill has no canon database — it builds one, the way a fiction copyeditor builds a **style sheet** (the trade's canon artifact — Amy Schneider's *Chicago Guide to Copyediting Fiction*; CIEP's fiction style-sheet practice). It extracts a compact record organized like that sheet:

- **Entities** — a fielded entry per character and place: appearance, age, relationships, established facts. Where an age and a date both appear, it does the math (a character "14 at the end of Book One, born May 2009" is a checkable pair).
- **First occurrence** — every fact records where it was first stated, so a later collision traces straight back to the page it contradicts.
- **Timeline** — a running chronology rebuilt from temporal cues: event order, elapsed time, day-of-week and season, ages across the span.
- **Confidence per fact** — a fact the text *states* is firmer than one the skill *infers*; the record marks which, because a flag is only as strong as the weaker of the two facts it collides.

**Error vs. device — the heart of the skill.** Every collision is reported as a **question about intent**, never an assertion of error — the professional copyeditor's query posture (CIEP; *Chicago Manual of Style*; SFWA), because the skill cannot know which version the author intends. Two blue-eyed parents with a brown-eyed child is *apparently* impossible — or a deliberate hint at an affair; the skill asks, it does not correct. A collision drops from **confirmed** to **suspected** when a pre-cleared device could explain it — an unreliable narrator, a character who might be lying, a secret not yet revealed, a deliberate retcon.

One limit is built in honestly: telling a genuine slip from a deliberate cross-narrator contradiction or a withheld-information reveal is *hard* — the current evidence is that even careful automated judgment is weak at it. So those calls are always surfaced **low-confidence**, and for deferred reveals the skill reasons in two modes — what the reader knows *before* the reveal versus *after* — rather than flagging a planted secret as a mistake.

## How it runs

1. **Intake** — scope, declared canon, intentional devices, known-fixed facts.
2. **Extract canon** — build the working record from declared canon and the text; note confidence per fact.
3. **Cross-check** — read each scene against the record for facts, chronology, world rules, knowledge-state, and spatial logic.
4. **Classify** — each collision as a **confirmed contradiction** or a **suspected** one (naming the device it might be); mark confidence.
5. **Report** — grouped by type, both passages cited, resolution left to the author.

## Output

A markdown **continuity report** — every entry a **query about intent**, never a correction, because which version is canon is the author's call. Two tiers keep a designed effect from masquerading as a mistake:

- **Confirmed contradictions** — the text genuinely says both things (chapter 1 versus chapter 12) and no pre-cleared device explains it. *Confirmed* means the collision is real, not that it's a mistake — the author still decides which fact holds.
- **Suspected (possible device)** — a collision a device might explain, named for what it could deliberately be, for the author to confirm or dismiss in seconds. Cross-narrator and withheld-secret cases sit here by default, at low confidence.

Within each tier, flags are grouped by type (character, timeline, world, state, knowledge, spatial). Every flag cites **both** conflicting passages with locations and the point each fact was first established, states the conflict plainly, and carries a confidence mark. Where the timeline is in question, it includes the **extracted timeline** the author can check against their intent. No resolution is written into the prose; the author chooses which fact holds.

## The shelf

What this skill reasons from — named as lineage, never reproduced:

- **The style sheet.** Amy Schneider, *The Chicago Guide to Copyediting Fiction* (its Characters / Places / Timeline structure), and **CIEP**'s fiction style-sheet practice — the trade's model for a compact canon record.
- **The query posture.** The *Chicago Manual of Style* and CIEP on raising an author query rather than silently changing, and the **SFWA** copyeditor's guide (Terry McGarry) on catching errors of logic and continuity — and its catalogue of the classic slips.
- **Declared canon.** The author's **story bible** — the novelist's adaptation of television's **show bible** — as the consolidated facts a manuscript is checked against.

## In this repository

The rules all thirteen skills share here are in `writing-skills`: what counts as the
book's canon, the wiki as research, designed cracks, German, where findings go and
how lines are cited. Read it first. For this skill:

- **Declared canon is the author's, and only that** (rule 2): decided records,
  approved chapters, and the rulebook and treatment once they exist. Build the working
  record from those first, infer the rest from the manuscript, and say which is which.
- **The sources are not canon.** The wiki holds the sources' positions on some facts the
  text uses: C7 on Juna's first appearance, C11 on heat and ozone, C12 on the Genesis.
  A collision between the text and a source is not a continuity error. Report it, if at
  all, as research context naming the record, and never as a correction.
- **The book's numbers are facts to track.** This narrator counts: temperatures,
  sequences, floor plates, unit and component numbers. The numbers belong in the style
  sheet's word list and anchor the timeline. A number that changes between chapters is
  a query.
- **Knowledge state has a ledger.** Once the treatment's reader-knowledge ledger exists
  (the plan, Phase 2c), check the text against it: what the reader, Kael and AEGIS may
  know by this chapter. Reason before and after each reveal, upstream's two modes.
- **Designed devices** (rule 4): the veil, amnesia never named, unlabelled voices, the
  ending's two readings. A collision one of them could explain goes under *suspected*,
  at low confidence.
- **Output:** `Plan/runs/writing/kap-NN/continuity-editor_<date>.md`, with both passages
  cited `file:Lnn`.
