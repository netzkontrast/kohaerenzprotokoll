description: Use to route a bounded task among available models, tools or specialists using explicit capability descriptions. Returns advice; does not switch a host primary model or install a router.

# Choose a tool, model or specialist

## Setup: choose the service or simulation

Check only the presence of `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; never
print credentials. Respect the user's already chosen mode. For a new setup,
prefer the user's existing OpenRouter account; otherwise offer official TypeSafe.
If OpenRouter is missing, explain that direct TypeSafe is also real Jev. Do not
silently change destination, send data, create an account or switch the host model.

If no route has been chosen, explain the available routes and ask:

> **A — Real Jev:** use/get an OpenRouter key at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
> if you use OpenRouter; otherwise use/get a TypeSafe key at
> https://console.typesafe.ai. Configure it locally, not in chat.
> **B — Simulate:** use the current agent, or an explicitly selected available
> model such as DeepSeek, with the same context, questions and criteria.

**Wait for an explicit choice.** Do not ask again for every record in the same
approved task. API errors do not authorize switching providers or simulation.
Missing both keys is not a dead end: offer B. It requires no Jev key but the
chosen agent/model's ordinary access, usage costs and privacy terms still apply.
Do not assume DeepSeek is installed, free or locally hosted.

In B, return `mode: agent_simulation` for the current host or
`mode: model_simulation` for another explicitly approved model, plus its actual
model identity when available and `jev_called: false`. Each question has `value`,
`needs_review`, a brief evidence-based `reason`, `probability: null` and
`confidence: null`. Choice values must be supplied labels, Noul values booleans,
and Score values integer rubric indices. Use null/review for missing evidence.
Never present this as Jev, calibrated probability or equivalent speed/accuracy.
Skip Jev CLI/API steps in B; use the approved model's existing interface and do
not install a substitute or send data elsewhere without consent.

In A, select the CLI destination explicitly: `--provider openrouter` or
`--provider typesafe`. The latter uses `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and maps the bundled
OpenRouter model ID to `jev-1.13.0`. `--dry-run` only validates; it neither
classifies nor makes a network call. `jev-decide setup` reports presence only,
not key validity, credits or permission. For guided setup and a copyable
DeepSeek prompt, use `jev-setup` or the [setup guide](https://github.com/wuyoscar/jev-skill/blob/main/skills/jev-setup/SKILL.md).

## Jev API prerequisite and first example

In Jev API mode, use the shared `jev-decide` CLI (Python 3.10+), installed from the reviewed
`jev-skill` package. If unavailable, explain the missing dependency rather than
silently installing software. The agent process must inherit
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for the chosen provider; never place the key in a prompt or request file.
No sibling skill or third-party integration is required for this judgment.
Actual UI, file, mailbox or simulation actions require the host's own tools.

Resolve `<skill-dir>` to this installed folder. Copy and edit
[assets/example.json](assets/example.json) for the user's task; it is synthetic
input, not a captured successful result. Validate it without a key or API call:

The commands below default to OpenRouter. For the official route, append
`--provider typesafe` to both validation and live calls.

```bash
jev-decide decide <skill-dir>/assets/example.json --dry-run
# After reviewing the input and authorization to send it to the chosen provider:
jev-decide decide /path/to/edited-request.json
```

Normal calls send the supplied evidence to the selected Jev provider and incur
usage. Read relevant answers, not only the exit code: `0` means selected/scored,
`2` means review, `1` means error. A confidently false Noul is still false;
selection is not permission. Unknown, missing or conflicting evidence needs a
fallback. Test thresholds on the user's task rather than assuming 0.9 is safe.

## Workflow

1. Inventory actual available capabilities, allowed spending and task constraints. Do not infer access from a model name or prestige tier.
2. Describe each candidate by what it can and cannot do. Supply the current subtask and relevant preceding state, not an entire unrelated transcript.
3. Separate selection from invocation. Show a recommendation unless the user already authorized the handoff and the host has an invocation tool.
4. Preserve fallback routes for unavailable, uncertain or failed candidates. A recommendation does not authorize sharing data with another provider.
5. Evaluate routing regret and completed work along with total cost, cache loss and retries. This skill is not the upstream Codex Router service.

## Context and parallelism

Jev does not inherit the agent's history. Give every request sufficient context:
the subtask and goal, relevant prior attempts, data constraints, budget, and real
candidate capability/availability descriptions. Model names alone are not enough;
omit unrelated conversation and secrets, not facts needed to choose a useful route.

Batch independent routing and suitability questions over shared state instead of
serial LLM calls. Route independent queued tasks with bounded concurrency, stable
task/question IDs, rate limits and a cost/time budget. The host schedules calls;
the CLI has no parallel scheduler. Questions cannot read other answers in the same
request: wait for a delegated result before deciding its dependent next route.
Use Jev's low latency for selection; retain a reasoning model for open-ended work.

## Make it yours

Replace the example's evidence, candidate IDs and criteria together. Preserve a
no-match route when the real task can fall outside the labels. Agree on how the
host or person consumes each answer before enabling any automatic effect.
