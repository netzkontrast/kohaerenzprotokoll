# Deep Reading

Read a file completely and produce a structured content map.

## Process

1. Read the ENTIRE file (no cutoff)
2. Produce content map: sections, named entities, standalone content
3. Gap analysis: search the relevant Codex detail pages with
   `scripts/wiki_fts.py ... --scope codex`, then compare against Canon/ and the
   plan documents for missing entries, `[L]` gaps, and claims that contradict a lock

## Output

```
## Content Map: [filename]
### Sections
1. [Heading] (lines X-Y) — [one-line summary]
### Named Entities
- Characters: [list]
- Locations: [list]
- Concepts: [list]
### Gaps
[Missing entries, truncated content, orphaned sections]
```

## Out of Scope

Does NOT modify files. Read-only analysis.
Does NOT audit for contradictions (use /auditing-physics).
