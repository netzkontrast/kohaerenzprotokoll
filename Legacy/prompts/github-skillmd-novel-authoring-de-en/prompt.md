# GitHub SKILL.md Novel-Authoring Repositories (DE/EN) — Stub Prompt

> **Execution:** Executed externally by Google Gemini.
> **Result:** [`research/gemini/github-skillmd-novel-authoring-de-en/result.md`](../../research/gemini/github-skillmd-novel-authoring-de-en/result.md)
> **Analysis task:** [`tasks/003-analyze-skillmd-novel-authoring/`](../../tasks/003-analyze-skillmd-novel-authoring/)

This stub exists to preserve the `Prompt → Research` audit graph per `RESEARCH.md` §6.3. The research was executed outside the repository by Google Gemini; the result was ingested per the External Research Ingestion workflow.

## Original Research Intent

Extract and evaluate GitHub repositories implementing the SKILL.md open standard for novel-authoring and fiction writing, with strict filtering for bilingual applicability in English and German.

Classify repositories as:
- **Klasse A** (Weight 1.0): Dedicated novel-writing repos with normative workflows, YAML frontmatter, and SKILL.md conformance.
- **Klasse B** (Weight 0.5): Generic skill collections containing at least one conforming writing/authoring skill.

Apply the Quality Signal Rubric (GitHub stars, last commit recency, README quality, license, CI/tests) and document key architectural patterns: multi-agent orchestration, progressive disclosure, externalized state management, bilingual processing nuances, and anti-slop linting.


## Framework

RISEN+ReAct, retrofitted by Task 020. The original prompt above predates the canonical headings; this section restates the framework for fm-validate header conformance. Refine when the prompt is next executed.

## R — Role

See the prompt body above for the executor persona. Future authors SHOULD condense the role declaration into this section.

## I — Input

- See the prompt body above for the inputs the executor reads.

## S — Steps

1. Refer to the prompt body above for the original step ordering.
2. Future authors MUST normalise the step list under this heading.
3. Each step SHOULD declare exactly one RFC 2119 keyword.

## E — Expectations

- Refer to the prompt body above for the deliverables.

## Constraints

- The agent MUST NOT execute this prompt as-is without first authoring the canonical sections above; the migration is structural, not semantic.
- Future authors SHOULD treat the body migration as a T3 change per MAINTENANCE.md §1.
