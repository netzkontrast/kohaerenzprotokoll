summary: "Epic umbrella for novel-architect@1.1.0 — orchestrates 7 sub-tasks (071-077) that implement Sub-Module Refactor + Dramatica-Native Integration (Worksheet-Loop, Hard Rules, Anti-Patterns, Scene-Level-Bridge) + selective Dual-Kernel Patterns (Canon-Status Schema, MIF Level 3, SessionStart-Hook). Goal: skill becomes dramatica-native instead of dramatica-delegating, structured into 4-5 sub-skills following Dual-Kernel Architect pattern."

# Task 070 — novel-architect@1.1.0 Epic

## Goal

Coordinate the v1.1.0 release of `skills/novel-architect/` across 7 linked sub-tasks (071-077). The Epic is `done` when:

1. All 7 sub-tasks have `task_status: done` OR `task_status: updated` with documented disposition
2. `skills/novel-architect/SKILL.md` references the new sub-module architecture
3. `tools/check-governance.sh` exits 0 (gating checks pass) after all sub-tasks land
4. A v1.1.0 changelog entry is appended to `skills/novel-architect/references/learnings.md`
5. **Test scaffold exists** for `skills/novel-architect/render/` (pytest tests for `io_helpers.py` + `render_*.py`) — addresses [PR #101 review §3](https://github.com/netzkontrast/agency/pull/101#issuecomment-4422239250) "No automated tests"
6. **Bilingual DE/EN contract documented** in `SKILL.md` — addresses PR #101 review §2.7 ("German + English mixed; intentional, but call out the bilingual contract so contributors don't 'normalize' it")
7. **Legacy retirement criterion** explicit (see §"Legacy Retirement" below) — addresses PR #101 review §4.3

This Task itself contains **no diffs** — diffs land via sub-tasks. This Task is the orchestration / dependency-tracking artifact.

## Legacy Retirement Criterion (PR #101 review §4.3)

`skills/novel-architect-legacy@0.3.3-archived` is retained as a fallback during v1.1.0 development. It MUST be removed via a follow-up Task when ALL of the following hold:

- (a) The Kohärenz Protokoll project workspace at `/home/claude/novel-projects/kohaerenz-protokoll/` has been used productively in ≥3 separate sessions without falling back to the legacy skill;
- (b) The NCP-Validation of the migrated `kohaerenz-protokoll.ncp.json` passes against the latest `ncp-author` schema (run automatically via `scripts/bootstrap_project.sh`'s `validate_ncp()` helper);
- (c) No `task_blocked_by` entries on legacy paths remain in `tasks/`.

When all three hold, file a new Task `<NNN>-retire-novel-architect-legacy` that `task_supersedes: ["novel-architect-legacy"]` and removes the directory. Until then, the legacy skill stays.

## Context

v1.0.0 (PR #101, commit `ee1daac`) refactored `novel-architect` to be project-agnostic with 8 phases, NCP integration, methods library. Deep analysis revealed two improvement axes:

**Axis A — Dramatica-Native:** v1.0.0 delegates to `dramatica-theory` and `dramatica-vocabulary` but does not systematically *use* their 13 reference files. Worksheet (00-storyform-worksheet.md), Hard Rules (00-storyform-validation.md), Decision Heuristics (10-decision-heuristics.md), Anti-Patterns (11-anti-patterns.md), Scene-Level-Bridge (12-scene-level-bridge.md), Worked Examples (13-worked-storyforms.md) are unused.

**Axis B — Dual-Kernel Patterns:** The `/home/user/Dual-Kernel/` project has methodological patterns (MIF Level 3 memory, autopoietic loops, SessionStart hooks, canon-status conflict schema, ETL pipeline) that selectively apply to long-running novel projects.

The user's scope decision: **Sub-Module Refactor + all 4 Dramatica integrations + 3 Dual-Kernel patterns** (Canon-Status Schema, MIF Level 3 for learnings, SessionStart-Hook lean). Full plan in `/root/.claude/plans/bitte-baue-aus-den-velvety-bentley.md` (local).

## Sub-Tasks (children)

| Task ID | Title | Blocks/Blocked-by | Affects |
|---------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **071** | Sub-Module Architecture Refactor | foundation (none) | skills/novel-architect/ (structural) |
| **072** | Phase 2 Worksheet-Loop (00-storyform-worksheet.md) | blocked by 071 | phases/phase2-narrative-architecture.md, methods/storyform/ |
| **073** | Hard Rules Validation (H1-H12) | blocked by 072 | phases/phase2-, methods/validation/, assets/hard-rules-check.md |
| **074** | Anti-Patterns durchgängig (AP-1 bis AP-14) | blocked by 071 | phases/phase2-, phase3-, phase6- |
| **075** | Scene-Level-Bridge Q1-Q5 | blocked by 071 | phases/phase5-, phase6-, references/ncp-integration-contract.md |
| **076** | Canon-Status Conflict-Schema | blocked by 071 | phases/phase4-, phase7-, assets/canon-meta-schema.md |
| **077** | MIF Level 3 learnings + SessionStart-Hook (lean) | blocked by 071 | references/learnings.md, scripts/session-start.sh, schemas/mif-level3.yaml |

**Dependency graph:**

```
        ┌──── 072 ──── 073

```

## Plan

1. **Land 071** (Sub-Module Architecture Refactor) first — establishes the directory structure and orchestrator pattern that 072-077 depend on. Output: skills/novel-architect/SKILL.md updated, sub-module skill stubs in skills/novel-architect-{character,structure,world,scene}/.
2. **Land 072, 074, 075, 076, 077 in parallel** — each independent after 071. Order does not matter; commits can be sequential or interleaved.
3. **Land 073 after 072** — Hard Rules validation depends on the worksheet structure from 072.
4. **Verify Epic acceptance** — all 7 sub-tasks `done`; `tools/check-governance.sh` exit 0; update SKILL.md to reflect v1.1.0; append changelog to learnings.md.

## Todo

- [x] 1. Land Task 071 (foundation)
- [x] 2. Land Tasks 072, 074, 075, 076, 077 (parallel after 071)
- [x] 3. Land Task 073 (after 072)
- [x] 4. Update SKILL.md frontmatter: `version: "1.1.0"`, `date_updated`
- [x] 5. Append v1.1.0 changelog entry to `references/learnings.md`
- [x] 6. Add bilingual DE/EN contract note to `SKILL.md` (PR #101 review §2.7)
- [x] 7. Scaffold pytest tests under `skills/novel-architect/render/tests/` covering: `atomic_write`, `validate_slug`, `utcnow_iso`, `render_intent`, `render_architecture`, `render_scene_matrix` (single+dual storyform_count). Goal: ≥80% line coverage on `render/`. Addresses PR #101 review §3.
- [x] 8. Verify Legacy Retirement Criterion (a)/(b)/(c) status; if all met, file follow-up Task; else document blockers
- [x] 9. Run `tools/check-governance.sh` → exit 0
- [x] 10. Update PR #101 (or new PR) — close Epic
