# Task 073 — Hard Rules Validation (H1-H12)

**What:** Inserts a pre-Gate-3 validation step that runs the 12 Hard Rules (H1-H12) from `dramatica-theory/00-storyform-validation.md` against architecture.yaml. Failures surface in the status-view; user must fix or override before approval.

**Why here:** Without this gate, v1.0.0's Gate 3 only checks NCP schema compliance — not Dramatica storyform integrity. Schema-pass architectures can still violate Dramatica fundamentals (e.g. OS+MC in same Class), leading to drafting confusion downstream.
