# History

## Recent Schema Updates

- Added optional `subtext.storybeats[].appreciation` as a derived interoperability field based on `throughline + scope + sequence`.
- Clarified that Storybeat importers should derive the appreciation identity when the field is omitted so lighter-weight payloads remain compatible.
- Clarified that canonical Storybeat objects do not expose a `signpost` key; any internal grouping should be derived from structural scope, sequence, and parent relationships.
- Closed the primary canonical narrative shapes so unexpected keys now fail validation unless a shape explicitly supports extension metadata.
- Clarified that Perspective, Player, and Overview IDs are opaque strings. Plain UUIDs are acceptable and type prefixes are optional.
- Canonicalized overview labels to the exact Title Case enum values `Logline`, `Genre`, and `Blended Throughlines`.
- Clarified that import/normalization layers may still accept legacy overview labels such as `logline`, `genre`, `blended_throughlines`, `Premise Overview`, and `Four Throughlines Extraction`, but canonical export/validation now requires the Title Case enum.
- Added an optional `story.ideation` object for pre-narrative concept development, with required domains `character`, `theme`, `plot`, and `genre` whenever `ideation` is present.
- Added lightweight shared ideation node validation requiring `id` and `summary`, with open metadata for beginner and LLM-assisted workflows.
- Added optional `narratives[].status` with canonical values `candidate`, `draft`, and `complete` to represent potential or in-progress narratives without splitting data into separate arrays.
- Made `subtext.storypoints[].narrative_function` and `subtext.storybeats[].narrative_function` optional so blank-slate templates can omit narrative function assignment until later authoring.
- Preserved backward compatibility for existing stories by keeping `story.ideation` optional and retaining `story.genre` as a concise top-level story label.

## Recent Canonical Terminology Updates

- Added Character-framing Storypoint Appreciations as canonical-valid labels: Character Intentions, Character Repercussions, Character Adaptations, Character Affectations, Character Engagements, Character Perks, Character Pressures, and Character Forebodings.
- Clarified that these labels normalize to the original linear-focused appreciation families for interoperability (centered on Story Goal and Story Consequence).
- Clarified usage guidance: linear stories use linear-focused appreciations, while holistic stories may use either linear-focused or Character-framing appreciations.

## The Dramatica Theory of Story

Originally developed by Chris Huntley and Melanie Anne Phillips in the early 1990s, the Dramatica® Theory of Story offered a groundbreaking approach to narrative structure, emphasizing the interplay of multiple perspectives to create cohesive and resonant storytelling experiences. Launched in 1993 and comprehensively documented in their seminal 1994 book, *“Dramatica: A New Theory of Story,”* it introduced an objective model of narrative defining clear, measurable dynamics underpinning every compelling story.

By mapping relationships between characters, plot elements, and thematic concerns, Dramatica established itself as a unique and influential framework. Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) builds directly upon this legacy, refining and extending these foundational concepts to embrace modern advancements in AI-driven storytelling.

## Evolution & Development of Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)

Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) was developed as a next-generation schema for multi-agentic systems, designed to enhance narrative consistency, scalability, and AI-driven storytelling capabilities.

**Version 1.0 of NCP** mirrors the robust API framework available within Narrative First’s Subtxt/Dramatica platform. Engineered for narrative precision and innovative AI-driven storytelling, the Subtxt/Dramatica platform encapsulates an objective, measurable approach to narrative structure.

Narrative First chose to openly share this schema, driven by the belief that storytelling should be accessible and transparent to everyone. By opening the "code" behind narrative structure, the goal is to foster creativity, collaboration, and innovation across all storytelling communities.

## The NCP Project at ETC/USC

Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) is driven by an extraordinary team of visionaries and narrative experts dedicated to revolutionizing storytelling through technology and innovation. Funded by USC’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), the project benefits from the strategic leadership of Executive Producer Paul Bennun, whose extensive experience at the intersection of entertainment and technology shapes the project's ambitious vision.

Project Lead George Gerba, renowned for his pioneering approach to narrative technologies, oversees the implementation and evolution of NCP, ensuring the protocol remains both groundbreaking and practical for contemporary narrative artists.

Narrative theorist Hank Gerba further enriches the project with his profound understanding of narrative structures and generative AI. His influential white paper, [*"NARRATIVE CONTEXT PROTOCOL: AN AUTHOR-CENTRIC STORYTELLING FRAMEWORK FOR GENERATIVE AI,"*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04844) has become a cornerstone for those exploring the powerful intersection of storytelling and artificial intelligence.

Together, this dedicated group is charting a forward-looking path, passionately committed to empowering authors and creators with cutting-edge tools designed to amplify human creativity and narrative ingenuity in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI storytelling.
