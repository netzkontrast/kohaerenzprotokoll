# Friction Log — Kickoff Run

**FL0** — frictionless run.

## What was attempted

The kickoff scope from the prompt: corpus inventory + cross-skill ID audit + scenario-tag survey, no schema authoring or skill modification. All three evidence streams completed; reflection notes (M01 + M07) authored.

## Friction observed

- **None at session level.** Tools cooperated; the Explore subagent returned a usable inventory in one call; greps for the contradictions were direct and reproducible.

## Minor non-blocking notes (FL0 still)

- The Explore subagent over-counted the elements file (71 vs canonical 64). This is content-level signal (meta-entries inside the term file), not session friction — flagged correctly in the inventory as a schema-design implication and turned into Contradiction #4 in the M07 log.
- The `task.md` Target Architecture proposes `ncp_appreciation_partial: false` as default; the audit showed this is wrong (most ontology entries should *omit* the field, not flag it `partial: true`). This is a finding the kickoff is *for*; surfacing it counts as success, not friction.

## What would have been FL1+

- Tools failing or returning malformed output → did not happen.
- A subagent burning >30K tokens to retrieve the inventory → the actual call returned in one round, well under budget.
- Discovering during synthesis that a fourth or fifth contradiction class existed and required re-walking the corpus → did not happen; the three audit dimensions in the prompt covered the surface.
- Discovering that the eleven scenarios were the wrong granularity (e.g. all eleven map to the same five files) → did not happen; survey shows clean spread across the term universe.

## Action items

- None at the friction level. All forward-pointing actions land in `output/SPEC.md § Recommendations for Task 015`.
