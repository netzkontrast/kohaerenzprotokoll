Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

1

Summarized chain of thought (Quasipolynomial bounds for
arithmetic progressions)

OpenAI

The two tasks seek progressively stronger density bounds for arithmetic progressions. The first devel-
ops an argument for the reciprocal-sum problem; the second seeks a quasipolynomial bound for every
fixed progression length, using the previous reciprocal-sum bound and reorganizing the precision costs
of successive density increments.

Part I: The reciprocal-sum problem

Original prompt (excerpts)

# Problem

Let N_0={0,1,2,...}, and let A be a subset of N_0 such that sum_{n in A, n>=1} 1/n diverges to
infinity.

Prove or disprove that A contains arithmetic progressions of every finite length: for every integer
k>=1, there are integers a>=0 and d>=1 such that a,a+d,...,a+(k-1)d all belong to A. The
requirement d>=1 makes the progression nontrivial for k>=2.

A disproof must provide a set with divergent reciprocal sum and some fixed length k>=3 for which no
such progression exists.

1 Seeking structure without losing the density gain

The assistant begins by asking whether a divergent reciprocal sum forces arithmetic progressions of ev-
ery finite length. It uses Bloom and Sisask’s three-term reciprocal-sum result [3] as a baseline, alongside
Green and Tao’s polylogarithmic bound for 𝑟4(𝑁) [17] and Gowers’s general quantitative bound [13],
then seeks stronger bounds for longer progressions.

Let 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) be the largest size of a subset of {1, … , 𝑁} with no nontrivial 𝑘-term progression. Convergence
of

𝑗≥1

would suﬀice for the reciprocal-sum conclusion. Qualitative density decay alone does not supply this
summability. Reading the Leng–Sah–Sawhney bound [35] directs attention to losses incurred when
structured density increments are converted into ordinary progressions. The underlying quasipolyno-
mial inverse theorem [36] offers controlled nilsequence dimension, but the assistant identifies the ac-
cumulation of many weak correlations as a further cost. The assistant proposes retaining structured
ambient sets through successive increments and borrowing sparse counting and high-moment ideas
from Kelley–Meka methods [33].

For sparse counting it studies Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini, and Kelman’s grid norms and binary-system
counting lemma [12], seeking a higher-order analogue. It also consults the relative sifting argument
for corners of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney [28], particularly the need to avoid losses from
the density of a sparse ambient set. The proposed extension encounters several obstacles. The positivity

mechanism useful for three-term progressions does not directly extend to longer rooted counts. A tensor-
product sketch questions whether fixed uniformity norms can control sparse normalized functions, but
the assistant does not complete the sketch. The assistant therefore turns toward relative correlations,
higher moments, and compression of many dependent polynomial phases.

Bloom and Sisask’s exposition [4] supplies the unbalancing, sifting, and almost-periodicity frame-
work, including the Schoen–Sisask almost-periodicity input [49]. The assistant tries to combine the
linearization and symmetry steps familiar from the 𝑈3 inverse theorem [18] with Croot–Sisask smooth-
ing [9], while preserving relative correlation on a selected set of shifts. For higher orders it considers
quantitative inverse theory, including Manners’s bounds [41], as a possible ingredient without complet-
ing that extension. The assistant proposes aligning several frequency functions simultaneously, instead
of accumulating losses through sequential alignment:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

No iterative losses if align all frequencies at once. Great. Need ensure S_h can be recovered from
frequencies with large correlations ≥exp(-poly).

This would organize correlations of pair products 𝑓 (𝑥)𝑓 (𝑥 + ℎ), where 𝑓 = 1𝐴/𝛼 and 𝛼 = |𝐴|/𝑁. The
assistant still needs to preserve relative correlation and complete the counting argument.

The assistant then identifies an obstruction: upper density bounds on structured pieces permit rare
empty pieces. Centered products can concentrate on those holes. Adding a constant background briefly
appears to furnish a pseudorandom majorant, but the resulting error is too large relative to the diluted
density. Adaptive filling introduces further feasibility conditions that the assistant has not proved:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

However majorant on *all* rare atoms likely unrealistic due to impossible upper and lower
simultaneously for constructions with systematic holes.

It returns to simultaneous frequency alignment while continuing to seek a counting lemma.

2 Sparse counting, product obstructions, and an entropy route

With 𝜇 = 1𝐴/𝛼, 𝔼𝜇 = 1, and 𝑀 = 𝛼−1, the central question was whether upper bounds on structured
concentration could force positive progression counts with affordable dependence on 𝑀. The assis-
tant considered Green–Tao transference [20], inspected Zhao’s arithmetic transference proof [53], and
studied Conlon–Fox–Zhao densification [7]; it found that the latter relied on two-sided linear-forms es-
timates. The sparse graph counting lemma of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini, and Kelman [12] supplied the
model for asymmetric grid moments and positive-semidefinite unbalancing.

Upper bounds alone repeatedly encountered sparse holes. Large centered grid moments could reflect
missing mass rather than upward concentration, while weighted Cauchy–Schwarz retained factors that
obstructed induction. The assistant considered allowing small power losses in 𝑀 if localization costs
accumulated additively, but obtained no suitable counting theorem. It also considered Croot–Sisask
smoothing [9], finding its required accuracy too costly in the proposed application.

Product amplification offered another route. A suﬀiciently strong recurrence for extremal progression-
free densities might yield summability across exponential scales. Fiber bounds did not multiply automat-
ically, however, and constant-norm spheres obstructed the hoped-for strong decay over fixed digit alpha-
bets. The assistant compared Green–Tao four-term bounds over finite fields and integers [19, 17] with
the Leng–Sah–Sawhney progression bound and quasipolynomial inverse theorem [35, 36]; attempted

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

lifting and iteration still lost too much quantitatively.

Returning to hypergraph links, the assistant proposed high-moment control of common-neighbor

degrees:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Excellent, products degree fluctuations handled with polynomial precision! Then for fixed u, H'
path common-neighbor also concentrated for y,z even weighted. Can we use to control signed g' vs
path distribution with required precision c^p?

The assistant noticed that signed expansions could have absolute mass of order 2𝑝, overwhelming poly-
nomial accuracy. The assistant explored using the quasipolynomial corners bound of Jaber, Liu, Lovett,
Ostuni, and Sawhney [28] on parameters of partial progressions, but the resulting corners did not auto-
matically assemble longer progressions, while positivity of the four-term box count did not control its
exceptional diagonal.

The investigation then turned toward entropy at scale 𝑝 = log 𝑀, drawing on the Kelley–Meka use of

high moments [33]:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

So can leverage entropy instead of L² by nonnegativity and frequency dissociative (Chang).
Kelley-Meka essentially accounts for many tiny biases via Lp.

The assistant next sought a Fourier restriction estimate ‖̂𝜇𝑔‖𝑞 = 𝑂(1) for bounded 𝑔 and fixed 𝑞 > 2,
under suitable local upper bounds. Independent-frequency estimates suggested a starting point, but ex-
tracting structure from high moments lost too much mass. The final calculation tried to express sampled-
character moments positively so local bounds could apply. The assistant left the calculation unfinished,
without deriving either the restriction lemma or the sparse counting principle.

3 Endpoint restriction and the limits of sparse counting

With normalized density 𝜇 = 1𝐴/𝛼 and logarithmic sparsity 𝑝 = log(1/𝛼), the aim is to exploit upper
density bounds on small structured factors without repeatedly paying powers of 1/𝛼.

The assistant first tries Fourier restriction for four-term progressions. The assistant considers the Ben-
Sasson–Ron-Zewi approximate-duality approach [2] to extract structured frequency subsets, but finds
the contemplated iteration loses too much quantitatively. Truncating rare coherent peaks works for
independent frequency clusters, but extending that argument to dependent clusters remains unresolved.
The assistant uses Kelley–Meka convolution estimates [33] and high convolution moments to propose
an endpoint Fourier ℓ3 estimate:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Aha! Exactly weak ℓ^3 from convolution and cap. Need strictly better (<3) for interpolation.

The calculation subsequently reaches a full endpoint bound under its convolution hypotheses, but fails
to cross the exponent-three threshold needed by the proposed counting argument. Longer progressions
introduce further higher-order obstructions.

The assistant then asks whether upper counts alone can force lower progression counts. Complete
box norms offer a possible mechanism, whereas negative cubic contributions obstruct a straightforward
extension to progression systems. A separate reduction to colored additive matchings encounters a pro-
posed linear-algebraic barrier: for 𝑡 blocks with 𝑚 parameters each, generic diagonal scaling forces the

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

relation rank to satisfy 𝑅 ≥ 𝑚𝑡/2. The assistant finds that this defeats the specified closure construction’s
intended slice-rank saving.

It also considers discretizing Keleti’s full-dimensional progression-avoiding construction [31], but

does not obtain the logarithmic-density lower bound that this counterexample route would need.

Returning to sparse counting, the assistant revisits the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah,
and Sawhney and their density-increment argument [36, 35]. It calculates how repeated progression
restrictions can exhaust the available length, and recalls Green and Tao’s density-increment approach in
New bounds for Szemerédi’s theorem, II [21] while considering whether stronger increments or localization
could reduce this loss.

It also reexamines Conlon, Fox, and Zhao’s densification argument [7]: the required two-sided linear-
forms information would already include the lower counts sought here, so the assistant does not obtain
them from upper bounds alone. Returning to Bloom and Sisask’s exposition of Kelley–Meka [4], it
studies whether sifting and almost-periodicity can instead supply a suitable positive convolution com-
parison.

The assistant identifies two linked diﬀiculties in sparse counting. Repeated density increments can
consume too much progression length, while greedy removal of dense cosets creates holes that manufac-
ture further apparent increments. The assistant therefore considers a bounded Fourier model 0 ≤ 𝑔 ≤
1 + 𝑂(𝜀) approximating a nonnegative 𝐺 in Fourier ℓ3. In an adaptive partition calculation, it observes:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Great! Norm q≥2 localizes by averaging across disjoint equal subspace partitions.

Allowing different refinement directions in different cells might control complexity along each branch.
Yet an increment can occur on an extremely rare child, leaving typical branches almost unchanged and
refinement depth uncontrolled. The assistant leaves the proposed dense-model theorem and the needed
quantitative counting estimates conjectural, with refinement depth still uncontrolled.

4 Polynomial factors and lower progression counts

Most calculations used a finite-field model: a nonnegative density 𝜇 of mean one, bounded by 𝑀 = 𝑒𝑝,
and its centered function 𝑔 = 𝜇 − 1. The desired structural hypothesis prohibited large density increases
on suitably simple cells.

An initial proposal used Kelley–Meka methods [33] to turn Fourier concentration into an absolute
variance increment. The assistant revisited Bloom and Sisask’s exposition [4], using its almost-
periodicity statement, drawn from Schoen and Sisask [49], to seek a subspace preserving mass on a
large-autocorrelation set. Adaptive partitions and polynomial-phase alignment were then intended
to keep approximation costs polynomial in 𝑝. For polynomial factors, it invoked the polynomial
bounds relating partition rank and analytic rank of Janzer and Milićević [29, 44], proposing to replace
biased top-degree combinations by lower-degree polynomials. The quantitative inverse estimates
needed for phase alignment were less certain: the assistant recalled Gowers and Milićević’s 𝑈4 inverse
theorem [14] and Milićević’s work on approximate quadratic varieties [45], while leaving its proposed
general finite-field estimate conditional.
It also compared the intended complexity costs with the
inverse theorem and density-increment bounds of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney [36, 35]. The assistant also
observes that upper bounds could fail to detect missing configurations:

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Testing upper over subfunctions and anchoring constants can't rule holes.

For progression counting, eliminating a sparse factor incurred a loss of order 𝑀−1. It then tries interpo-
lating moments of

𝑍(𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑞) = 𝔼𝑥

𝑞
∏
𝑗=1

𝑔(𝑥 + 𝑦𝑗).

Conditional on the proposed positive-product estimates, this suggested cancellation for grids with one
long axis. Rare structured holes nevertheless defeated stronger moment bounds: taking a large root
could erase the benefit of their small probability. Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz preserved useful support
restrictions only until the weights were replaced by approximations; completion weights could vanish ex-
actly where 𝜇 was supported. The relative Szemerédi framework of Conlon, Fox, and Zhao [7] suggested
a transfer route, but the assistant found that the needed lower estimates for linear forms reintroduced
the counting problem it was trying to solve.

The exploration then turned to an ideal jointly high-rank quadratic factor. Its four-term relation pro-

duced Fourier terms |

̂𝑓 (𝜉 )|2|

̂𝑓 (3𝜉 )|2 for a common real-valued factor function 𝑓 , suggesting positivity:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Good! Degree2 polynomial structure *doesn't obstruct same-set 4AP lower* when high-rank jointly.
Obstruction roots in low-rank/lower-degree factors.

The assistant next seeks quantitative estimates for that ideal model. A subsequent spectral-growth argu-
ment encountered a product-set counterexample, prompting an additional stability requirement under
conditioning. Entropy-based extraction still lost too much density. The assistant was still seeking a lower
counting theorem and a transfer from the finite-field model to integers.

5 From rare holes to a conditional convexity gain

The assistant’s sparse progression-counting arguments repeatedly encountered one obstruction: upper
bounds on concentration do not stop a sparse set from occupying rare holes in a completion function.
Proposed entropy projections sought to remove a small structured subspace; padding sought a non-
negative majorant with two-sided pseudorandomness. The padding proposal invoked Conlon–Gowers
transference [8]; the relative Szemerédi argument of Conlon, Fox, and Zhao [7] sharpened the con-
cern that an upper linear-forms bound alone would not fill these holes. The assistant did not complete
either construction. The assistant also considered Rankin’s progression-free constructions as possible
counterexamples [47], whose known density scale left a large gap to the desired logarithmic bound.
A decision-tree argument looked promising for complements of disjoint aﬀine subspaces, but overlap-
ping weighted constraints remained unresolved. Yannakakis’s clique-versus-stable-set communication
argument [52] suggested a related way to split disjoint rectangles; extending it to higher-order cylinder
intersections remained uncertain.

The spectral approach similarly recovered only a cubic singular-value bound. Gaussianizing corre-
lated directions consumed additional entropy along with the apparent gain. Hypergraph reformula-
tions exposed dependent links, and controlling positive moments of a completion function still failed to
control its zeros where the target weight concentrated:

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Need lower tail at μ_H. Upper moments no.

Redundant arithmetic witnesses and Croot–Sisask almost-periodicity [9] were then considered as ways
to fill those holes. Revisiting the graph-counting mechanism of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini, and Kelman
[12] highlighted the diﬀiculty of replacing graph common neighborhoods by cyclic hypergraph links. A
proposed sumset of missing endpoints required Cartesian families of partial progressions too large to
expect even in random sparse sets.

The assistant next used independent shifts of a normalized density 𝜇, with 𝑔 = 𝜇 − 1. Expanding
∏𝑗 𝜇(𝑥 + 𝑢𝑗) into products of shifted copies of 𝑔, the assistant proposed applying uniform convexity
in Fourier ℓ3. The Kelley–Meka method and Bloom–Sisask exposition [33, 4] motivated the positive-
product bound needed here. Conditional on that bound, exchangeability would supply an inverse bino-
mial factor and hence exponential decay for centered products. The assistant reacts:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

This solves k=4 counting lemma via Holder! Also arbitrary matrices S3 via cotype martingale? Need
positive upper binomial-type *norm* for patterns.

It next examines the positive-product bound needed for this gain. Extending the argument to longer
progressions generated shift grids whose cycles destroyed independence. Inside a quadratic atom 𝐵,
centering also had to use 1𝐵/ dens(𝐵), introducing costly density factors. Local Fourier norms and a
relative Bessel inequality suggested repairs, but the resulting ambient transfer could be signed. The
assistant also revisited the polynomial analytic-rank-to-partition-rank bounds of Janzer and Milićević
[29, 44] as a possible route from bias to lower-degree structure. The bounds of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney
[35] remained a quantitative comparison; their inverse theorem and Manners’s cyclic-group inverse
theorem [36, 41] were considered as inputs, with the required finite-field analogue still uncertain. The
assistant was left seeking positivity, spread, controlled iteration, and a passage to the integers.

6 From random restrictions to the cancellation barrier

For a nonnegative function of mean one bounded by 𝑒𝑝, the target was a positive progression count with
losses at most exponential in a polynomial in 𝑝. The working assumption excluded density increments
on factors generated by relatively few polynomial tests. The assistant kept Green–Tao’s four-term bound
and the Leng–Sah–Sawhney bounds and inverse theorem as quantitative benchmarks, while questioning
the finite-field inverse input needed by its proposed transfer [17, 35, 36].

Building on its own preceding proposals, the assistant first sampled aﬀine subspaces contained in a
polynomial atom. Restricting to these spaces preserved progression avoidance, but transferring local
structure back to the ambient space threatened excessive complexity. The assistant then tries Hahn–
Banach separation: measure the residual by its average restricted phase correlation, and require bound-
edness only of the separating functional. It observes:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

no need residual cap except in dual where bounded. Excellent!

The proposed decomposition still lacked an affordable iteration. Counting also produced repeated-point
contributions that could overwhelm the progression signal.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

7

The convolution estimates continued to draw on Kelley–Meka sifting, Bloom–Sisask’s exposition, and
Croot–Sisask almost-periodicity [33, 4, 9]. The assistant also noted that the linear-forms hypotheses in
Conlon–Fox–Zhao’s relative theorem supplied more than its upper-only spread assumption [7].

Attention shifted to higher-order norms. Fixed cube norms appeared to undercount many indepen-
dent polynomial modes, while repeated Hölder inequalities amplified rare structured holes. The next
proposal replaced a potentially exponential spectral-energy budget by an entropy budget of order 𝑝. In-
dependent structured projections could share that smaller budget; dependencies among them prevented
a completed argument.

The final stage tried polynomial spectral models and penalized least-squares approximations. Match-
ing moments did not preserve positivity. Approximating progression dual functions directly in 𝐿2,
through bias and the partition-rank bounds of Janzer and Milićević [29, 44], led it to a further diﬀiculty:
grouping nearby phases could destroy cancellations. Small partition-boundary probabilities became
inadequate after multiplication by large coeﬀicient sums:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Need a norm-based operator bound for Schur multiplier error rather than entry absolute.

The remaining target was sharper control of four-factor Fourier sums through energies on low-
dimensional aﬀine subspaces. The assistant had not resolved the cancellation problem: its proposed
route still required an affordable decomposition, control of repeated-point contributions, and a
norm-based estimate that survived grouping phases. It therefore left the finite-field counting target
and the subsequent transfer to integers as further steps.

It also reconsidered the binary-system counting theorem of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini and Kelman
and the corners bounds of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni and Sawhney as possible reductions [12, 28]. Its
proposed lifts still failed to force a longer collinear progression: a corner supplied a parallelogram, and
the simple-graph representation encountered a rank obstruction.

7 From adaptive holes to compressed polynomial constraints

The assistant sought lower bounds for longer progression counts from upper bounds on conditional
densities. For a set of density 𝛼 = 𝑒−𝑝, its normalized indicator 𝜇 = 1𝐴/𝛼 has mean one but can reach 𝑒𝑝.
This large cap made rare exceptional holes decisive: estimates adequate for ordinary averages could fail
when tested against the sparse set itself.

Kelley–Meka moment estimates remained a model for controlling convolution and Fourier en-
ergy [33]. The assistant also considered Sanders’s small-doubling structure [48], but did not obtain the
desired small-codimension control from it. Adaptive Fourier projections briefly offered a way to avoid
enumerating all structured factors. An empirical Fourier multiplier controlled projected energy in
expectation, but the required exponentially small tails remained unavailable. Hypergraph containers
needed too many moments; the Conlon–Fox–Zhao densification framework [7] risked assuming the
lower count it was supposed to prove. Croot–Sisask almost-periodicity [9] suggested sampling shifted
completions, but preserving a deficit on a sparse test set required more accuracy than the assistant could
supply. Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz produced facet-weighted cubes, yet their needed high-moment
estimates recreated the original diﬀiculty. Spectral entropy and martingale proposals likewise failed
to prevent complexity or entropy from concentrating in unfavorable places. The assistant explored
the global hypercontractivity of Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer [30] as a source of Fourier level
bounds; concentrated dependencies and high levels still obstructed the proposed counting argument. It
compared the goal with Green–Tao’s polylogarithmic four-term bound [17] and Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s
longer-progression bounds [35], without finding an amplification that closed the gap.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

The assistant next asks how to iterate a finite-field increment, assuming it can obtain the increment
lemma. In an atom defined by polynomial equations, aligning local phases introduced many lower-
degree corrections. The proposed repair retained the original equations as expressions in auxiliary
variables, then averaged substitutions for discarded directions. Processing variables by degree might
preserve both polynomial degree and the number of constraints.

Nested aﬀine flats were then proposed to separate rank requirements by degree. The assistant tried to
use Lampert–Ziegler relative rank and regularization [34] to make each layer’s rank requirement depend
on that layer and the higher ones. It invoked the polynomial analytic-rank/partition-rank comparisons
of Janzer and Milićević [29, 44] when turning biased polynomial combinations into lower-degree pieces.
The quantitative inverse input remained uncertain: it recalled the Gowers–Milićević finite-field 𝑈4 the-
orem [14], contrasted finite-field needs with the Leng–Sah–Sawhney integer inverse theorem [36], and
still needed the appropriate hypotheses and bounds for the proposed iteration.

Finally, summing lifted field coordinates suggested that integer carries might cancel with polynomial
rather than exponential probability loss. Its image was too small, and enlarging it left collapsed progres-
sions and carry constraints unresolved. The assistant ended with the increment theorem still assumed
and with unresolved steps in both its iteration and the transfer to integers.

8 From slab collapse to entropy counting

The assistant moved from finite-field embeddings toward an entropy-based counting principle for inte-
ger arithmetic progressions, motivated by its earlier candidate four-term argument.

The embedding proposal restricted sums of canonical coordinate representatives to intervals of width
less than half the field size. This forced their second differences to vanish, so vector progressions mapped
to integer progressions. But nonzero vector directions could lie in the kernel of every block sum, pro-
ducing constant images. Density increments on simple residue classes reinforced this collapse:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Finite-field linear tests fully expose residue at small cost (log q bits), so reduction fails
structurally, not just counts.

The assistant revisited the Leng–Sah–Sawhney density-increment and inverse-theorem inputs [35, 36],
while continuing to question the quantitative finite-field inverse statement its proposed transfer would
require. It also retained the limitation of the binary-system counting theorem: the simple-graph encod-
ing did not directly handle longer progressions [12]. Its polynomial-factor calculations used the poly-
nomial analytic-rank/partition-rank bounds of Janzer and Milićević [29, 44]; the relative-rank approach
of Lampert and Ziegler remained an input whose precise applicability it wanted to check [34].

Attention returned to normalized sparse densities bounded by 𝑀 = 𝑒𝑝. Upper spread constrained
their averages on structured sets, but could not directly exclude a completion function vanishing on
the entire target set. The exploration reused Kelley–Meka convolution and sifting ideas, including
the almost-periodicity formulation in Bloom–Sisask’s exposition [33, 4], and considered Croot–Sisask
smoothing of partial-completion functions [9]. Positive covering certificates, weighted localization, and
phase-based norms were explored. Repeated Hölder amplification created correlated grids, whose
aligned holes defeated the hoped-for independent cancellation; subgroup-block examples also defeated
a proposed spectral comparison.

The assistant contrasted its upper-only hypotheses with the linear-forms conditions used by Conlon,
Fox, and Zhao’s relative Szemerédi theorem [7]; the missing lower estimates blocked a direct densifica-
tion argument. An abstract replacement asked whether normalized simplex-facet kernels, with uniform
proper marginals and upper control on large cylinder intersections, must have positive joint count. The

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

9

assistant did not find a proof of this lower bound or a derivation of its hypothesis from polynomial
spread.

A coordinate-filtration approach then exploited pairwise independence: surviving progression correc-
tions involved at least three innovations. Absolute innovation estimates nevertheless counted irrelevant
late spikes:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Thus simple martingale fails. Maybe choose **adaptive basis via polynomial inverse** such that
relevant frequencies revealed early before spikes materialize.

A proposed comparison retaining two arbitrary weighted marginals might charge each correction to
𝑒3/2
, with ∑𝑗 𝑒𝑗 ≲ 𝑝. Small steps 𝑒𝑗 ≤ 𝑡 would then cost 𝑂(𝑝√𝑡). Large steps remained dependent on
𝑗
enormous previously revealed prefixes, and transferring them recursively escalated complexity. It turns
to compressing the previously revealed prefixes while preserving the proposed comparison.

9 From entropy jumps to positive grids and integer obstacles

The assistant sought progression-count estimates for a normalized density 𝜇 ≤ 𝑀 = 𝑒𝑝. Entropy incre-
ments along finite-field coordinates summed to at most 𝑝, suggesting that suﬀiciently small increments
might have a controllable total effect. The assistant considered transference through the linear-forms
conditions of Conlon, Fox and Zhao [7], but large revelations resisted this argument: repeated transfer-
ence magnified errors, and backward coordinate deletion failed because parity-type dependencies could
force every coordinate to remain.

Random subspaces and graph-label formulations concentrated the diﬀiculty but introduced too
many Fourier modes or left a new counting problem. It also considered the same-set hitting frame-
work of Hązła, Holenstein and Mossel [26], observing that exact progression relations fell outside
the straightforward product-space route. Continuous revelation did not remove the obstruction:
pairwise-independent endpoints can have zero joint product, whereas bounded continuous orthogonal
martingales would preserve its expectation.

The direction changed when correlated aﬀine functions produced individually nonnegative covari-

ance kernels,

𝔼𝜎 𝜈𝑖(𝑢)𝜈𝑖(𝑣) = 1 − 𝑡 + 𝑡𝑢𝑣,

0 < 𝑡 < 1
2 ,

while their cross kernel had a negative 𝑢𝑣-coeﬀicient. A deficit in the full progression count could con-
sequently become an excess in a mixed average.

The assistant then identified what this proposal still required.

It proposed Hölder and Cauchy–
Schwarz bounds for the excess through positive additive-grid averages, but still needed the grid bounds
or a structural consequence of their failure.

The next stage made that dependency explicit:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

This is big. Need convert single-grid excess to density increment over integers with manageable
complexity, avoid previous integer relative transfer burden.

Isolating a grid cell suggested a positive correlation against functions of proper subsums. Proposed in-
teger conversions used nilsequences, multidimensional boxes, or direct comparison with a structured
baseline. Repeated interval restrictions accumulated excessive losses. Large boxes might reduce degen-
eracy, but conditioning and lifting remained unresolved; Bohr neighborhoods introduced exponential

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

10

geometric normalization losses, while coeﬀicient heights could grow despite dimension control. The
assistant continues to seek an integer density increment from the kernel reduction.

In pursuing the integer conversion, the assistant returned to Kelley–Meka sifting, Bloom–Sisask’s ex-
position, and Croot–Sisask almost-periodicity as models for controlling sparse convolutions [33, 4, 9].
It recalled the three-term reciprocal-sum consequence of Bloom–Sisask and the polylogarithmic four-
term bound of Green–Tao [3, 17], while keeping the graph-specific scope of the binary-systems result
of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini and Kelman in view [12]. For longer progressions it examined the nilse-
quence inverse theorem and density-increment argument of Leng, Sah and Sawhney [36, 35]: repeatedly
localizing to intervals still accumulated excessive losses.

For a possible finite-field transfer, it proposed using the polynomial analytic-rank-to-partition-rank
bounds of Janzer and Milićević [29, 44] to reduce biased polynomial combinations to lower degrees,
and Lampert–Ziegler relative rank and regularization [34] to control successive constraint layers. It
treated the required sampling and complexity estimates as dependencies still to check. For the integer
analogue it identified Leng’s eﬀicient equidistribution of nilsequences [37] as a possible source of a
degree-reduction step, but did not establish that the needed form followed.

10 Degree reduction and alternating local decompositions

If 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of [𝑁] without a nonconstant 𝑘-term arithmetic progression, the
target was 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)2. The assistant combined the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem with
their progression-decomposition strategy [36, 35]. With 𝑝 = log(1/𝛼) for density 𝛼, repeated restrictions
had to consume only polynomial complexity in 𝑝.

The assistant examined Leng’s quantitative nilsequence equidistribution results [37], but found that
their horizontal-character obstructions did not supply the required degree reduction: lowering nilpotent
step can leave polynomial degree unchanged. It also reconsidered the step-lowering mechanism for
periodic nilsequences [38]. The assistant proposed a suspension:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Key idea! Linearize polynomial nilsequence via suspension to linear sequence in s-step nilmanifold
with standard lower central series, preserving dimension and complexity.

The assistant then notices that an integral drift can disappear modulo the lattice, defeating its proposed
subgroup restriction. Derivative representations offered another route, yet dividing by a small phase
mean incurred prohibitive costs.

Green–Tao local quadratic inverse methods and their polylogarithmic four-term progression argu-
ment suggested working in local charts [18, 17]. Green–Tao–Ziegler nilcharacter calculus then informed
the proposed derivative representations [22].

Attention shifted to domination against positive lower-degree tests and then to a convolution com-
parison with an arbitrary nonnegative baseline. Simultaneous derivative bias and anchoring suggested
alignment mechanisms, but closure under translated weights remained unproved. Variance also failed
to guarantee useful progress when concentrated on rare spikes. Attempts to construct convolution
predictors used Croot–Sisask sampling and Sanders’s Bogolyubov–Ruzsa mechanism, but encountered
label-entropy and difference-set obstacles [9, 48].

The proposed repair alternated independent Bohr-set pieces, used to remove spikes, with matched
pieces, used to detect convolution nonuniformity. A concave potential (ℎ𝑤)𝜃, where ℎ, 𝑤 are local means
and 0 < 𝜃 < 1/2, was intended to control dependent refinements and unfinished branches. Kelley–

ments [33]. The assistant examined the finite-field and local Bohr almost-periodicity statements in
Bloom–Sisask, including their Schoen–Sisask input, as the analytic bridge [4, 49]. The assistant accepted
the local comparison at this stage, but repeated conditioning on structured atoms could still multiply
complexity. Flattening existing phases incurred excessive losses; a hierarchy of local coordinates became
the next proposal. The assistant left the comparison proof and the higher-degree iteration unfinished.

Reconsidering the finite-field comparison also brought back the Janzer and Milićević polynomial rank
bounds and Lampert–Ziegler relative regularization as possible controls on nested sampling [29, 44, 34].
The assistant still needed to check their quantitative dependencies. It also retained the earlier obstacle
to applying Conlon–Fox–Zhao relative counting: the required control of linear forms in the envelopes
was missing [7].

11 Keeping relative density increments affordable

The assistant next considers the cost of repeating density increments. If 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) denotes the largest size of
a subset of [𝑁] without a nonconstant 𝑘-term arithmetic progression, the desired bound was 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪
𝑁/(log 𝑁)2. With relative density 𝛼 = 𝑒−𝑝, repeatedly replacing structural dimension 𝐷 by 𝐷𝐶 would
consume the available scale. Building on its own earlier proposals, the assistant sought new complexity
controlled by relative density rather than the rarity of an existing structured region 𝐵:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Need relative inverse theorem *increment count* depending only relative density*, rather than
black-box HB paying b.

Here HB denotes Hahn–Banach decomposition. The assistant used the inverse-theorem framework of
Leng, Sah, and Sawhney [36] as background and sought a relative extension.

The principal construction sampled aﬀine boxes 𝜓(𝑡) = 𝑥+𝑣⋅𝑡 on which 𝐵 was nearly constant. A local
test into a small nilmanifold would then have to become a global test into the same target. Interpolation
alone could not preserve correlation: a character nearly constant on a small box might average to zero
globally. Conditioning boxes to stay inside 𝐵 could also make the sampling event too rare. Encoding
finite-field progressions in integers brought separate carry and collapsed-direction obstructions.

The finite-field comparison invoked Lampert–Ziegler relative rank and regularization [34], while
retaining uncertainty about the precise regular-tower hypotheses, and Janzer’s polynomial compari-
son of partition and analytic rank [29]. For nilsequences, the assistant examined Leng’s periodic and
multiparameter equidistribution results [38, 37], hoping to lower degree without repeated dimension-
dependent factorization. It contrasted this with the cost of quantitative Leibman factorization [23] and
recalled the nilcharacter-symbol framework of Green, Tao, and Ziegler [22]; the required compatibility
of the lifted coeﬀicients remained a proposed step.

The assistant proposes representing 𝐵 as a product of smooth tests. If every added test retained suf-
ficient relative mass and stable output size, logarithmic mass and complexity costs could accumulate
additively. It therefore asks for a transfer theorem supplying those hypotheses. Ordinary polynomial
phases offered a simpler setting for coeﬀicient matching before confronting nilpotent structure.

The assistant used the Schmidt-type recurrence and progression decomposition of Leng, Sah, and
Sawhney [35] to estimate neighborhood mass and the losses from repeated localization. Green–Tao’s
local 𝑈3 inverse theorem [18] suggested a model for adding structure on Bohr sets, and Manners’s
periodicization construction [42] was considered for cyclic versions. Recalled comparison arguments
combined Kelley–Meka sifting [33], Croot–Sisask convolution smoothing [9], and the Bohr-set almost-
periodicity theorem in Bloom–Sisask’s exposition [4]. The assistant also retained its objection to the

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

12

Conlon–Fox–Zhao transference route [7]: the required linear-forms control was precisely what its sparse
argument had not supplied.

The assistant then asks to preserve only correlations needed for one density increment. A variance

estimate of order 𝐿−𝑚 still could not control a candidate family of size 𝐿𝑂(𝑑𝑚𝑠) for degree-𝑠 maps:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

However to correlate with f∘ψ, h must align with f model (low entropy) in top tensor space,
constraints leave free components not needed (prune).

This suggested discarding irrelevant coeﬀicients and lifting the remaining coordinates layer by layer
while respecting commutators. The assistant left the quantitative lifting theorem and the full iteration
as tasks still to be completed.

12 Why controlling dimension does not control width

The assistant sought a density increment inside a structured region 𝐵. With density 𝛼 = 𝑒−𝑝, the goal
was to add only poly(𝑝) coordinates per increment while preventing their required precision from over-
whelming the iteration.

Local nilsequence tests were first to be lifted from aﬀine boxes to the integers. The assistant consid-
ered Leng’s eﬀicient equidistribution and periodic step-reduction results, while questioning whether
their hypotheses covered the required multiparameter boxes [37, 38]. It also tested a recollection of
high-characteristic nilspace splitting against explicit periodic Heisenberg examples [6]. A proposed
simplification used global coeﬀicient lifts and one random constant in a projection kernel to reproduce
a joint distribution. Incompatible lattice gauges still obstructed simultaneous lifting. Using Leng–Sah–
Sawhney inverse estimates and progression localization as quantitative inputs [36, 35], the assistant ob-
tained a conditional budget calculation by grouping increments before resetting the structured region,
but nonlinear dependence on previous precision could defeat it.

The assistant revisited Kelley–Meka sifting and Bloom–Sisask almost-periodicity in its proposed pos-
itive convolution comparison [33, 4], and recalled Green–Tao’s locally quadratic approach to four-term
bounds as another model [17]. The next route conditioned progression counts on 𝐵, generating addi-
tive grids through repeated Hölder inequalities. Their final two positions remained coupled. A bounded
coupling density could favor positive inner products even when the separate Gram kernels were non-
negative, invalidating the hoped-for independence substitute. Taking absolute values erased the useful
negative contribution.

Ordinary polynomial models suggested absorbing some lifted frequencies into existing coordinates.
Later, selecting independent frequency equations gave a proposed pointwise alignment between a local
test, a global polynomial, and a slow drift. This simplified algebraic compatibility without controlling
the drift’s oscillation. Fixed weighted degree likewise suggested polynomial dimension growth, yet
hidden floor variables and localization costs remained unresolved.

A proposed relative inverse principle also raised the question whether Conlon–Fox–Zhao transfer-
ence and its linear-forms hypotheses could remove losses depending on the width [7]. Sampling whole
atoms, traversing short discrete labels with long kernel directions, and using high-dimensional boxes
each encountered further obstacles. A positive quadratic phase, modeled by ‖𝑢‖2/𝐿, forced substantial
shortening:

Positivity smooth irrational low-rank counterexample forces log cost factor 2 independent d!

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

13

The assistant then pulled the integer set back from a finite-field aﬀine space, where kernel directions
create degenerate progressions. Their proportion alone did not settle the necessary comparison with
progression bounds. The assistant was still seeking a width-stable increment theorem, with the finite-
field comparison unresolved.

13 Amplifying density gains without multiplying dimension

With density 𝛼 and 𝑝 = log(1/𝛼), the obstacle was the expense of conditioning on an increasingly narrow
structured region: inverse-theorem accuracy and subsequent localization depended too strongly on that
region’s tiny mass.

The quantitative inverse and progression-decomposition estimates of Leng–Sah–Sawhney framed this
cost problem [36, 35]. Seeking cheaper inverse estimates, the assistant recalled the polynomial Freiman–
Ruzsa results of Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao in characteristic two and bounded torsion, but did
not obtain the needed integer-group analogue [15, 16].

The proposed escape was to increase the gain per iteration. Several small increments might form a

packet giving a large fixed factor 𝐾.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Then multiplicative increment factor K per iteration, choose K huge enough to absorb block
constants! This is extremely important.

The assistant distinguishes coordinate count from precision. Widths might deteriorate rapidly, provided
the exponent controlling their recurrence remained independent of 𝐾, and the number of coordinates
stayed polynomial with a similarly uniform exponent. The assistant needed a packet lemma with these
uniform exponents for the parameter calculation to apply.

One route toward a larger gain sought a bounded model: a suitable positive majorant would permit
Conlon–Fox–Zhao relative Szemerédi transference [7], but the proposed domination argument encoun-
tered rare overlapping tests. A second route considered the Lovász–Szegedy graph-limit characteriza-
tion through homomorphism densities and reflection positivity [40]; the assistant could not obtain the
mixed-sign positivity or counting transfer needed for its sparse weights.

Attempts to lift local tests globally exposed scale feedback. Short coordinates became frozen labels;
accounting for them demanded greater approximation accuracy and hence larger sampling boxes, which
encountered further scales. Enlarging an ambient cyclic group created many apparent directions but
only a short effective progression in the original integers. Finite-field and product models likewise left
unresolved whether a detected progression would collapse to one point or incur excessive losses when
controlling carries. A direct, density-dependent large increment also failed its cost comparison: the next
test’s complexity outgrew the gain.

For finite-field regularization, the assistant revisited a construction conditional on Lampert–Ziegler
relative rank estimates, using Janzer’s analytic-rank to partition-rank bounds in its proposed rank
checks [34, 29]. On the integer side, it considered Green–Tao’s local quadratic inverse theorem and their
polylogarithmic four-term progression bound, while questioning whether the local inverse costs could
fit its logarithmic-density budget [18, 17]. Leng’s periodic and multiparameter nilsequence equidistri-
bution results remained candidates for aligning local tests, with their precise lifting application still
unresolved [38, 37].

The exploration returned to conditional counting, using Gaussian weights or polynomial coeﬀicient
data to seek replication costs depending on 𝑝, rather than the conditioning mass. The underlying com-
parison proposal combined Kelley–Meka variance and sifting ideas with Bloom–Sisask Bohr almost-
periodicity [33, 4]. The remaining task was to control the number of new structural coordinates in the
comparison and inverse steps.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

14

The assistant thus focused the relative lifting problem on uniform coordinate bounds, while retaining
its doubts about the absolute comparison argument on which the proposed density iteration depended.

14 Controlling dimension through repeated density increments

The assistant sought a density-increment proof of Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture. Its central diﬀiculty
was quantitative: structure detected inside an already constrained region had to be transferred to the
ambient integers without making the number of coordinates grow too quickly. Writing 𝑝 = log(1/𝛼) for
density 𝛼, repeated updates 𝑑 ↦ 𝑑𝐶 could exhaust the dimension budget long before enough fixed-factor
density gains accumulated.

The assistant tried conditioning polynomial Taylor coeﬀicients to construct a sampling law, then iden-
tified uncontrolled sparse marginals and exceptional fibers. Linear Bohr regions admitted progression
charts; higher-degree regions did not have comparable aﬀine charts with the required cube distributions.
Finite-field encodings introduced wraparound and carry losses, while grouping increments into packets
still retained excessive dimension growth.

The dimension calculations revisited the inverse-theorem and progression-decomposition bounds of
Leng–Sah–Sawhney [36, 35]. For the convolution stage, the assistant considered Kelley–Meka concentra-
tion arguments [33], Bloom–Sisask almost-periodicity [4], Croot–Sisask smoothing [9], and Sanders’s
Bogolyubov–Ruzsa lemma [48]; the diﬀiculty was keeping their costs under control inside the old con-
straints. It also reconsidered a bounded-majorant route to the Conlon–Fox–Zhao relative Szemerédi
theorem [7], but the needed two-sided control was missing.

Green–Tao’s polylogarithmic four-term bound suggested examining local quadratic methods [17].
The assistant considered whether the binary-system counting method of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini, and
Kelman could bypass higher-order structure, but could not encode the required longer progression that
way [12]. It also recalled possible distinct-degree polynomial methods without settling their bounds or
a reduction to ordinary progressions. In the finite-field model, it revisited relative-rank regularization
in the style of Lampert–Ziegler, leaving the needed sampling and threshold dependencies open [34].

Polynomial charts led to a more concrete idea for short coordinate directions. For an ordinary degree-𝑟
polynomial, comparison with a fixed short-coordinate slice gives

𝑃(𝑡) − 𝑃(𝑡long, 𝑎) = ∑
𝑗

(𝑡𝑗 − 𝑎𝑗)𝐷𝑗(𝑡),

deg 𝐷𝑗 ≤ 𝑟 − 1.

The assistant proposed descending through these lower-degree terms:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

For degree r≥2, if difference has fast variations depending short axes, can express via
lower-degree polynomials t_j and mixed terms without Weyl!
The assistant then encountered further obstacles in extending this ordinary-polynomial proposal to
nilsequences. Rational and smooth corrections introduced floor coordinates whose number was still
uncontrolled. The assistant considered Leng’s periodic nilsequence step reduction [38] and reread the
multiparameter equidistribution estimate [37], observing that its constants depended on the number of
parameters. Separating quadratic coeﬀicients into oscillatory and structured components led to circular
precision requirements.

The absolute comparison remained unverified.
A subsequent proposal maintained a high-dimensional unconstrained box, spending dimension to
preserve side length. The assistant found that its initial encoding cost exceeded the budget. It then tried

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

15

noninjective aﬀine maps, but observed that localized progression directions could all lie in the map’s
kernel. Ensuring nonzero image directions reintroduced the missing relative sampler. The assistant next
considered prime-power digits and entropy, while still seeking the relative sampler needed to continue
the density-increment argument.

15 From relative smoothing to positive sampling laws

The assistant shifted from relative counting to transferring local gains, seeking density increments strong
enough for Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture. Hilbert cubes did not force arithmetic progressions, and
a replicated-grid calculation left a small but consequential excess exponent. The assistant tried asym-
metric Gaussian profiles and retained support indicators, then sought comparison estimates for them.

Before this smoothing proposal, the assistant considered Green–Tao transference through a pseudo-
random majorant, but did not find a suitable majorant for an arbitrary progression-free set [20]. It also
considered Conlon–Fox–Zhao densification [7] and a dense-model argument; the required accuracy
appeared to demand excessive pseudorandomness. Kelley–Meka sifting and the Bloom–Sisask almost-
periodicity theorem supplied the comparison framework [33, 4].

A proposed relative adaptation of Croot–Sisask sampling [9] then used reference-measure autocor-
relations and Fourier uniformity to seek smoothing costs independent of sparse support density. The
assistant proposed the following local analogue:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

For local Bohr, similar using relative convolution and locally embedded group with support. This
yields relative Croot-Sisask almost-periodicity under mere β autocorr and β' Fourier. Major
progress.

For finite-field sampling, the assistant revisited Lampert–Ziegler relative-rank regularization and
Janzer’s rank bounds, while explicitly questioning the required uniformity in the earlier layers [34, 29].
It considered local quadratic inverse arguments and Sanders’s local Bogolyubov–Ruzsa approach
to controlling new directions. Green–Tao’s polylogarithmic four-term bound suggested a separate
amplification route, but tensor products and fiber bounds did not supply the desired improvement [17].
The weaker bound for longer progressions remained a benchmark [35].

The assistant still needed a local argument and turned to retaining fixed widths for quadratic constraints
while shrinking their effective rational subspace. This was intended to prevent repeated coordinate elimi-
nation from multiplying precision costs. For structured approximation it continued to use the Leng–Sah–
Sawhney inverse theorem [36]. It examined Leng’s multiparameter nilsequence estimates, but did not
assume that they supplied the stronger degree-reduction statement or the dependence on the number
of parameters that it needed [37]. A lattice-based alignment proposal sought a decomposition of hor-
izontal coordinates into isotropic, rational, and slowly varying components. The assistant questioned
how to extend that quadratic mechanism to higher degrees.

The next obstacle was sampling: an aﬀine chart could overweight ambient points, invalidating separa-
tion estimates taken with uniform ambient measure. Truncating exceptional sampling weights required
bounds independent of chart length. Pair concentration also encountered congruence correlations and
circular choices of sampling dimension. Studying rational characters annihilating the chart’s slope ma-
trix suggested a common denominator in place of many unrelated moduli:

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

16

VERBATIM EXCERPT

This implies finite group generated by needed annihilators has exponent <D0 (or |group|≤D0^n),
eliminating lcm! This is key.

That proposed typicality argument motivated a positive ambient weighting reproducing a chart’s posi-
tion, residue class, and polynomial labels. Including such weightings in the approximation norm might
transfer a local gain under the assumption that no ambient density increment exists. The assistant left
uniform Fourier bounds, independence from polynomial constraints, smoothing of lattice labels, and
consistent parameter ordering as unresolved requirements for this transfer proposal.

16 Controlling dimension through graded lifting

The assistant addressed the dimension growth obstructing a density-increment approach to Erdős’s
reciprocal-sum conjecture. The desired conclusion was progressions of every finite length. Motivated by
Leng’s periodic and multiparameter nilsequence estimates [38, 37], it sought a relative lifting theorem.
For density 𝛼, put 𝑝 = log(1/𝛼). Grouping increments into a fixed multiplicative gain could tol-
erate narrower sampling regions, but required structural dimension polynomial in 𝑝. A recurrence
𝑑𝑖+1 ≤ 𝑑𝐶
𝑖 𝑝𝐶 defeated this strategy. Moreover, replacing a small local nilsequence by a large ambi-
ent comparison sequence imported hidden integer-part coordinates. The construction still had to cover
every fixed progression length, rather than only four-term progressions.

The assistant revisited several ingredients behind the proposed iteration. Kelley–Meka concentration
methods and Bloom–Sisask almost-periodicity supported its degree-one comparison strategy [33, 4]; it
also explored a weighted adaptation of Croot–Sisask sampling [9]. It considered applying the relative
Szemerédi theorem of Conlon, Fox, and Zhao after constructing a suitable majorant, but still lacked
the required two-sided control [7]. For a finite-field alternative, it relied conditionally on Lampert–
Ziegler relative-rank regularization and Janzer’s polynomial relation between partition and analytic
rank [34, 29]. Green–Tao’s local inverse approach to four-term progressions suggested another route,
whose quantitative dependence remained an obstacle [17]. The Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem
supplied candidate structured models, while their progression decomposition supplied the proposed
reset to ordinary progressions [36, 35].

Alternative routes through overlapping shorter progressions, Chinese-remainder independence, and
coordinate fibers produced no replacement argument. Bracket phases retained troublesome floor inter-
actions, and fiberwise bounds did not automatically multiply. Attention returned to a graded factoriza-
tion that would iterate over degree rather than ambient dimension. The assistant examined the dimen-
sion losses in Green–Tao factorization [23] and Leng’s comparison with the sunflower and linearization
steps in Green–Tao–Ziegler’s 𝑈4 inverse argument [37, 24]. It noted that Leng’s multiparameter theo-
rem allowed its exponent to depend on the number of parameters, leaving a further uniformity question.
Smooth and rational factors were to leave a subgroup annihilated in its highest layer by a vertical char-
acter. The assistant tried coeﬀicientwise adjustments to improve compatibility, then returned to the
derivative character and its quantitative bounds.

Conditioning on existing constraints introduced weighted floor variables.

It briefly considered
nilprogression-based dimension control for subgroup charts. A semidirect polynomial model sug-
gested rational potentials for these corrections; pruning Fourier modes before freezing short sampling
axes was intended to preserve useful correlation. To prevent recursive corrections from accumulating
coordinates, the assistant proposed:

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

17

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Better: align entire map g_P (auxiliary okay large) into SAME via iterative Fourier pruning and
simultaneous splittings, preserving local tests as modifications of one map into original target
with Y fixed.

Here 𝑌 denotes fixed ambient data. Quotienting a compatible central subgroup and reconstructing
the original target offered a more specific lifting scheme. The assistant still needed to resolve lattice
compatibility, well-defined actions, global bias, and eﬀicient factorization to complete this lifting scheme.

17 From graded regularization to a structured comparison problem

The density-increment strategy for Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture shifted from controlling polyno-
mial complexity to confronting arithmetic sampling obstructions. The assistant had proposed lifting lo-
cal tests while preserving marked projections. A graded revision would transfer a deficient top-degree
component to lower degree, bounding the total number of reductions. Integer-coordinate compression
was intended to limit the number of floor variables, but the assistant had not resolved its interaction
with boundaries and density.

The assistant revisited the finite-field regularization route using Lampert–Ziegler’s relative rank and
Janzer’s analytic-to-partition-rank bounds [34, 29]. For the integer problem, it contrasted Green–Tao’s lo-
cal inverse argument [17] with the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng–Sah–Sawhney [36], while
retaining the latter authors’ effective recurrence/localization input for a later return to a one-dimensional
progression [35]. Leng’s periodic nilsequence estimates remained a proposed source of subgroup iden-
tities [38]; the assistant also recalled that the multiparameter theorem’s exponent depended on the num-
ber of parameters [37].

The sampler had to accommodate both short and long lattice coordinates. Choosing its length only

after regularization appeared to replace an expensive power separation by a multiplicative gap:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

This previous failure was *power gap* L^{poly} requiring log L multiplying D times ->tower. Here
gap only factor A independent L!

The assistant noticed that narrow coeﬀicient jitter could leave discrete labels sparse and that real smooth-
ing lost rational oscillations. The proposed comparison weight therefore combined continuous informa-
tion with compatible congruence residues, seeking relative rather than absolute approximation for tests
of very small mass. A further simplification allowed the final density-increment region to replace the
old region, potentially reducing inherited complexity.

The assistant then encountered a dimensional diﬀiculty: an aﬀine sampler with ℓ < 𝑛 directions has
a singular image modulo every prime in an 𝑛-dimensional ambient box. In an ideal Chinese remainder
model, orthogonal decompositions offered useful contraction estimates, but too many singleton-prime
contributions survived. The assistant proposed using global hypercontractivity [30], later identifying
the sharp inequalities of Keller–Lifshitz–Marcus [32] as a possible ingredient, without yet deriving the
needed comparison estimate.
It also reconsidered Kelley–Meka’s weighted energy and sifting argu-
ments [33], together with the finite-field and Bohr-set almost-periodicity statements in Bloom–Sisask [4],
as models for adaptive comparison.

A counterexample then concentrated an arbitrary baseline on a union of rare congruence events. Small

restrictions left many events unseen, while a typical low-dimensional sampler missed the union.

The proposed repair used the actual baseline’s bounded-complexity nilsequence structure. Repeated
congruence sensitivity might force rational constraints, eventually producing stable averages. The assis-

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

18

tant left three steps to establish: this regularization, the hypercontractive comparison, and transfer from
ideal prime independence to finite boxes.

18 From physical residue mixing to symbol regularization

Continuing the attempt at Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture, the assistant sought quantitative bounds
on progression-free sets strong enough to force arithmetic progressions of every length. Several lemmas
in the proposed density-increment plan remained unverified.

The assistant recalled the contrast between Green and Tao’s polylogarithmic four-term bound [17]
and the longer-progression estimates, and the restriction that had prevented it from directly applying
the sparse graph-counting result of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini, and Kelman [12] to longer progressions.
The immediate challenge was transferring averages from a low-dimensional aﬀine sample 𝜓(𝑡) =
𝑥 + 𝑉𝑡 to a larger integer box. A formal product of prime-power residue spaces need not match the
physical distribution, and arbitrary comparison functions could concentrate on rare congruence events.
The proposed repair combined nilsequence stability under residue refinements with direct moment
estimates. For two sampled points, the greatest common divisor of the coordinates of 𝑡 − 𝑡′ controls
their shared congruence condition. Small gcds suggested lattice-counting approximations; large gcds
required a tail estimate. Approximate orthogonality and 𝐿2 control were intended to avoid inflated point-
wise bounds. For low-degree components, it considered global level estimates associated with Keller,
Lifshitz, and Marcus [32], and checked their applicability while developing a separate mixed Hölder
argument for dimension-independent bounds.

Attention then turned to the nilsequence stability needed by this transfer. Recalling its concern about
the parameter dependence in Leng’s multiparameter equidistribution approach [37], the assistant pur-
sued an elementary reduction in degree based on lattice calculations. Transporting full factorizations
across residue branches introduced conjugations and potentially new denominator primes. The pro-
posed alternative tracked leading homogeneous symbols, whose behavior under translation was sim-
pler. Independent rational constraints would shrink their common space; bounded degree and rank
decreases were intended to control repeated reductions:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Number of modes dimension poly. Iteration depth d bounded, so logS growth polynomial okay. This
could solve! Let's formulate hierarchical nil regularity.

The assistant proposed canceling earlier scaling denominators after further residue refinement as the
arithmetic mechanism for regularization. The assistant next considered smooth weights excluding
wrapped cyclic progressions and an induction transferring domination by degree-𝑑 nilsequence tests to
translated products tested at degree 𝑑 − 1. The planned inverse-theorem input was the quasipolynomial
result of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney [36]; their nilsequence recurrence estimate was to support the
eventual return to progressions [35]. The assistant still needed to justify common-anchor alignment
and lattice reconstruction. It reached the degree-one base as the final obstruction. Returning to the
Kelley–Meka method [33], it reread Theorem 17 of Bloom and Sisask [4] to obtain regular Bohr sets of
almost-periods for sifted convolutions, without completing the application.

19 From absolute increments to the relative lifting bottleneck

The sustained attempt to prove Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture now concentrated on transferring
density increments into regions already defined by structured tests. The assistant continued develop-
ing the proposed absolute machinery. A shift-comparison argument used Bohr-set refinement and the

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

19

concave potential (𝑢𝑣)1/4, where 𝑢, 𝑣 were local means, to pay for extracting unusually dense pieces.
High-moment unbalancing from Kelley–Meka and the local almost-periodicity theorem in Bloom–Sisask
(Theorem 17) were intended to produce further refinements [33, 4]; a proposed nilsequence degree-
reduction argument would extend the comparison beyond degree one. The assistant also used the
Leng–Sah–Sawhney quasipolynomial inverse theorem to seek nilsequence correlations with polynomial
logarithmic dimension bounds [36]. The proposed sampler remained unverified.

Positive-grid counting was then organized into packets of density increments. The relative step had to
keep rank growth linear in the old and incoming dimensions, with suitable polynomial bounds on loga-
rithmic complexity. Resetting the resulting structured region to an ordinary interval required a partition
into arithmetic progressions, rather than isolated recurrence points. While checking the needed dimen-
sion dependence, the assistant recalled Green–Tao’s quadratic approximation argument [21] and consid-
ered Maynard’s simultaneous polynomial approximation bounds, questioning whether their constants
would fit the iteration [43]. The assistant used the Leng–Sah–Sawhney progression-decomposition
lemma, whose polynomial dimension dependence supported this reset [35]. The assistant calculated
that suﬀiciently large packet gains, together with its transfer and reduction steps, would establish

𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪

𝑁
(log 𝑁)3

,

where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of {1, … , 𝑁} without a nontrivial 𝑘-term progression. Dyadic
summation would then imply the reciprocal-sum conclusion.

The transfer itself exposed two obstructions: sampled nilsequence tests varied too freely to select a
small fixed candidate family, and the sampler’s marginal density lacked the bound needed for a Hahn–
Banach separator argument. The proposed repairs localized tests before discretizing their parameters
and randomized constant polynomial labels to bound the marginal. The local-slice distribution still
needed checking:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Yes! Need ensure t distribution for cap when local slices?

A weighted semidirect-group calculation subsequently sought the identity 𝐹(𝑏) = 𝑉(𝑏) − 𝑉(𝑏 − 𝑥),
integrating a closed polynomial one-form to obtain a controlled decomposition into slow and rational
components. The assistant still needed cube comparison, scalar transfer, and uniform estimates for the
conditioned sampler to complete the proposed route to the density bound and the reciprocal-sum con-
clusion.

20 Sampling geometry and the limits of the alignment framework

The attempt sought a density-increment proof that a set of positive integers with divergent reciprocal
sum contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. It proposed grouping local increments into pack-
ets and lifting each packet while increasing the number of floor coordinates only linearly. A reset invok-
ing the Leng–Sah–Sawhney Schmidt decomposition [35] was then intended to produce a longer-scale
progression with increased density. The assistant sought the bound 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3 through this
lifting step and used dyadic summation to connect it to reciprocal-sum convergence on progression-free
sets.

The assistant also revisited a finite-field model:

it hoped to regularize polynomial towers using
Lampert–Ziegler’s relative-rank bounds [34], while explicitly leaving their required dependence
on layer widths to be checked, and invoked Janzer’s polynomial comparison of partition rank and
analytic rank [29] to transfer rank information from small restrictions. For the integer argument it used

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

20

the Leng–Sah–Sawhney quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36] to turn Gowers-norm detection into
nilsequence correlation, and Bloom–Sisask’s local almost-periodicity theorem [4] for the degree-one
shift comparison.

The main obstacle became a constrained aﬀine sampler 𝜓(𝑡) = 𝑥 + 𝑉𝑡. Polynomial constraints were
split into small continuous lifts and integer parts; rational subspaces introduced projected lattices whose
heights could be enormous. Cancellation between continuous covolume and lattice spacing suggested
a route to estimates independent of orientation, but the assistant had not resolved chart counting and
normalization. Parameter order was equally consequential:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

We cannot choose m after post-b because b may be (p+m)^D from all recursion. Need m fixed function
p before defining b.

Here 𝑚 is the sampling dimension, 𝑝 structural complexity, and 𝑏 a later accuracy budget. The devel-
oping construction classified lattice directions by scale, randomized polynomial coeﬀicients, and used
disjoint product blocks to seek Fourier decay. Cube comparisons would discard non-site Fourier modes
through high rank and represent the remainder by separated site factors.

The assistant simplified the proposed density comparison to total variation control:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Can avoid integration by parts many derivatives; just one L¹ variation. Yes. Need ensure cofactor
inverse stable for actual and ideal on good support in v, boundaries smoothing.

A second simplification used two-point comparisons for scalar transfer, avoiding classification of arbi-
trary ambient linear frequencies. Positive weights combining real densities and congruence laws were
meant to preserve density excess after removing large good primes.

The final scrutiny shifted to alignment: sample-dependent maps had to be replaced by one ambi-
ent polynomial map preserving a marked projection. Central quotients and fiber products offered an
induction mechanism, but the assistant still needed to prove compatible slice refinements, uniform re-
construction, and quantitative thresholds to complete the sampler theorem.

21 From weighted lifting to contraction audits

The attempt on Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture moved from constructing a relative lifting mechanism
to testing its analytic foundations. The immediate objective was to convert structured tests that vary
across aﬀine samples into one ambient test while keeping the number of integer floor coordinates under
control.

For a weighted homogeneous polynomial 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑏), the proposed decomposition separated a slowly
varying polynomial from a bounded-denominator rational polynomial, but only on specified rational
spaces 𝐾ℎ containing the existing high-rank directions. The assistant used the Leng–Sah–Sawhney in-
verse theorem [36] to turn local structured correlations into an ambient nilsequence correlation. A
semidirect nilpotent group encoded the calculation. Bracket differentiation and a weighted Euler iden-
tity were intended to supply a rational potential. The assistant found that obtaining slow variation
required substituting full constraint polynomials rather than just their leading terms.

Relative lifting then processed the floor coordinates by increasing weight. Tagged lower-degree copies
were introduced so that the potential ∑ℎ ℎ dim 𝑊ℎ decreased without uncontrolled growth of rational
heights. The assistant proposed a final coordinate bound 𝑑0 + 𝑠𝑑, with recursive budgets fixed before the
late rank and sampling thresholds. The proposed iteration reset to long progressions using the Schmidt

decomposition in Leng–Sah–Sawhney, Lemma 2.1 [35]. The assistant questioned whether this recursion
preserved positivity.

The audit first examined scalar transfer: conditioning on prime-power residues, restarting after new
denominator primes appeared, and controlling aﬀine-sample correlations through moment estimates.
It then concentrated on degree-one comparison over regular Bohr sets. Spike extraction was intended
to pay for exceptional cells through the concave potential (𝑢𝑣)1/4, where 𝑢, 𝑣 are cell means. For the
remaining cells, convolution moments and dependent random choice in the Kelley–Meka approach [33],
together with Bloom–Sisask’s almost-periodicity theorem (Theorem 17) [4], were meant to produce
variance and hence strict contraction.

The assistant found these checks locally favorable but continued to scrutinize extension of products to
the higher-degree square construction after interval restrictions, together with quotient-kernel normal-
ization. It continued checking the lifting and comparison arguments used to derive 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3
and hence reciprocal-sum convergence of progression-free sets.
The assistant recorded the resulting sign of the contraction:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

terminal zero. Thus γ positive.

22 Testing the proposed transfer architecture

The assistant now tests its proposed proof of Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture. Its quantitative target
is 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3, where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of [𝑁] without a nontrivial 𝑘-term
arithmetic progression. Dyadic summation would then give the conjectured implication.

The assistant recalls the Kelley–Meka three-term bounds and their possible extension to higher-order
boosting [33], alongside Green–Tao’s bound 𝑟4(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)𝑐 [17]. It also recalls why the sparse
graph counting approach of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini and Kelman does not directly handle longer pro-
gressions: the binary-system argument requires an underlying simple graph [12].

The audit follows a dependency chain. First, bias in polynomial nilsequence tests should force a re-
duction of the structured path’s top-degree algebra. The assistant checks shift comparisons, lattice co-
volumes, and removal of slow and rational coeﬀicients against elementary nilpotent examples. Next,
one-sided domination should propagate to lower-degree tests after multiplication by translated posi-
tive weights. A Bohr-set argument uses the concave potential (𝑢𝑣)1/4; higher degrees require derivative
correlations and positive reconstructions. The assistant also uses Bloom–Sisask Theorem 17 on local
almost-periodicity [4] while developing these propagation arguments.

For the structural modeling step, the assistant checks and uses the quasipolynomial inverse theorem
of Leng, Sah and Sawhney: at threshold 𝑒−𝑝, the nilsequence dimension is polynomial in 𝑝, while com-
plexity and inverse correlation are exponential in a polynomial [36]. Positive counting estimates would
yield an absolute density increment. The assistant finds that iteration still depends on a relative lifting
statement whose rank grows linearly with the previous rank. Without that control, the length losses
could overwhelm density amplification. To reset a block of increments on an unconditioned progres-
sion, it uses Lemma 2.1 of Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s Improved Bounds for Szemerédi’s Theorem, partitioning
into progressions on which the niltest oscillates little, then discarding short pieces using the average-
length bound [35].

Attention then narrows to scalar transfer along aﬀine samples 𝑡 ↦ 𝑥+𝑉𝑡. Prime-power conditioning is
intended to stabilize a bounded niltest baseline. Degree descent and strict reductions of a fast subalgebra
should terminate this process.

The assistant then reconstructs orthogonal residue-coordinate expansions, checks exceptional pairs

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

22

with large common divisors or small separation, and distinguishes complete coupling levels from in-
complete levels requiring contraction. It recognizes that conditioning costs must be fixed before choos-
ing the truncation cutoff. Revisions clarify lattice covers, covolumes, and separation arguments. It then
returned to the transfer and relative lifting statements used in its iteration.

23 Parameter uniformity in the proposed density increment

The assistant continued auditing its own developing argument for Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture.
The intended quantitative endpoint was

𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3,

where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a set in [1, 𝑁] without a nontrivial 𝑘-term arithmetic progression.
Dyadic summation would then force every such progression-free set to have convergent reciprocal sum.
The assistant also revisited the Bohr-set almost-periodicity input from Bloom and Sisask [4] in its

degree-one shift comparison.

The first audit sought to turn frequently observed local polynomial structure into one ambient patch.
A weighted polynomial was to admit a slow-plus-rational decomposition. Encoding translations in a
polynomial group produced a closed polynomial one-form, whose potential supplied the proposed
integrability step. Marked projections, central averaging, and induction on degree were intended to
preserve positivity and control the number of patch coordinates.

Attention then shifted to the sampling machinery on which that lifting depended. Cube comparisons
were supposed to eliminate Fourier modes that failed to factor through the sampled vertices, using
repeated Cauchy–Schwarz and a high-rank hypothesis. Product blocks supplied smoothing; Jacobian
estimates supported total-variation control. The proposed passage from a large ambient Gowers norm to
an ordinary nilsequence test used the Leng–Sah–Sawhney quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36]. The
assistant emphasized comparing individual structured twists separately:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

This comparison for **each** twist J no global joint test, so no lcm growth.

For scalar transfer, a positive forecasting weight combined continuous densities, inactive grid constraints,
and conditional congruence laws. Removing good-prime factors required pointwise control. A concrete
correction replaced a floor threshold by a ceiling threshold in the permanent sublevel argument.

The consolidated proposal combined these ingredients with an induction that lowered a weighted di-
mension potential whenever an old layer failed the rank test. Density amplification and decomposition
onto long progressions were then meant to make density gains pay for length losses. For that decomposi-
tion, the assistant used Lemma 2.1 of Leng–Sah–Sawhney [35], seeking long progressions on which the
nilsequence test varied negligibly compared with the score. But approximation bounds had to remain
independent of late sampling scales, lattice heights, and prime-depth cutoffs.

24 Auditing transfer, lifting, and quantitative rank control

The assistant subjects its proposed route toward Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture to a sustained audit,
moving from constrained sampling through scalar transfer to weighted lifting.

The intended density increment turns surplus density on a structured patch into another patch with
controlled additional rank. Polynomial constraints take values in rational spaces 𝑊ℎ, with small real lifts

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

23

and integer carries. Disjoint product blocks, smoothing, and Fourier cancellation are intended to com-
pare sampled cubes with ambient cubes while keeping early complexity bounds independent of later
sampling scales and rational heights. Carry consistency and the regularity of the resulting densities
receive particular scrutiny. The cube-to-ambient comparison uses Leng, Sah, and Sawhney’s quasipoly-
nomial inverse theorem to turn a large ambient Gowers norm into nilsequence correlation [36]; the
assistant also retains their effective Schmidt estimates among its stated inputs [35].

The next bottleneck is scalar transfer: positive scores on many local paths should yield a positive
ambient score using only ∑ℎ dim 𝑊ℎ extra patch coordinates. A forecasting weight combines continu-
ous, inactive discrete, and modular distributions. The assistant examines prime-power divisibility and
Fourier tails to avoid paying for an enormous common modulus. The assistant continued seeking ex-
plicit estimates.

Weighted lifting then uses a rational potential and successive graded factorizations to align local
patches. Positive localization selects standard small bumps, avoiding an excessive count of arbitrary
Lipschitz functions. Rank preparation moves failed directions down one weight, with termination con-
trolled by a decreasing potential:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Potential many cuts \(O(jD)\) because \(\sum h\dim W_h\) starts jD, each violation reduces
dimension h by1 and adds dimension h−1 line, net drop1.

Here 𝐷 counts the old slots at their lowest weight 𝑗. The assistant continues to check the proposed slot
bound, simultaneous Fourier approximations, and product errors.

25 Quantitative repairs followed by a foundational audit

The assistant revises and audits its proposed proof of Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture. Its target is

𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3,

where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of [1, 𝑁] without a nontrivial 𝑘-term arithmetic progression.
Dyadic summation would then force every such progression-free set to have convergent reciprocal sum.
The initial repairs concern quantitative dependence. Taylor arrays are compared with Haar measure
through controlled Fourier or Lipschitz tests, without claiming total-variation convergence. Lattice-fiber
estimates keep exponents dependent on a fixed number of output rows, rather than an expanding num-
ber of input coeﬀicients. Slow and rational factor adjustments are elaborated before attention returns to
the foundational step-drop and shift-comparison claims.

The audit checks how lattice covolumes, horizontal directions, and nested derivative brackets support
the proposed reduction of nilsequence degree. For degree-one shift comparison, the key danger is rank
growth: repeated increments must avoid dependence on the parent rank that would accumulate into a
tower. Regular Bohr sets, density extraction, and almost-periodicity are examined with this requirement
in view.

The assistant checks the hypotheses of Bloom–Sisask’s local almost-periodicity theorem, especially its
rank increment, while auditing degree-one shift comparison [4]. It also checks the progression-partition
lemma of Leng–Sah–Sawhney: the proposed iteration uses nearly constant nilsequences on long progres-
sions to reset a structured density increment [35]. Its nilsequence detection and modeling arguments
use their quasipolynomial inverse theorem for the Gowers norm [36].

The subsequent synthesis organizes positive structured patches, scalar transfer, constrained sampling,
and lifting into a proposed density-increment architecture. It targets rank linear in existing and newly

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

24

introduced patch slots; packaged density gains are intended to pay for progression-length losses. The
assistant also requires higher-degree reconstruction to preserve positivity. The assistant ends by formu-
lating detailed claims linking transfer, sampling, lifting, and the inverse theorem within this proposed
architecture.

26 Quantitative audits and a renewed circularity concern

The assistant now audits whether its proposed proof of Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture can support all
its quantitative dependencies, including its use of Bloom–Sisask almost-periodicity (Theorem 17) [4].
It rechecks the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney for the bounds on nilse-
quence dimension, complexity, and correlation [36], and their Schmidt decomposition lemma for the
progression reset and its length and oscillation estimates [35].

First, scalar transfer must preserve correlation with a nonnegative structured nilsequence under aﬀine
sampling. Residue conditioning and an orthogonal decomposition by coordinate subsets are intended to
control exceptional slices. A normalization issue appears: the sampling-density domination may exceed
the error budget unless the logarithmic parameter is enlarged first. The assistant proposes that repair
while also checking a novel step-drop lemma, positive progression counting, and whether repeated
refinements leave enough interval length for a final density contradiction.

The audit then reconstructs the polynomial sampler, separating lattice coordinates into inactive, mod-
erate, and enormous scales, alongside continuous directions. Dedicated products of variables generate
polynomial terms; differencing and rational approximation are supposed to suppress unwanted Fourier
modes.

The assistant identified cube-density comparison as the next diﬀiculty: its regularity bounds deteri-
orated as perturbations shrank, so it could not use them to dismiss those perturbations. The proposed
alternative compares the ideal and perturbed pushforward laws using Jacobian bounds and total varia-
tion. Further checks concern modular forecast weights, parameter ordering, and nilpotent lifting with-
out inflating the rank of the resulting structured patch.

The assistant calculated that its assembled iteration would give

𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪ 𝑁/(log 𝑁)3,

where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of [𝑁] without a nonconstant 𝑘-term progression. Dyadic
summation would then force every such set’s reciprocal sum to converge.

A remaining concern is that a physical mesh depends on a truncated expansion whose bound already
depends exponentially on the truncation parameter. The assistant leaves this circularity concern unre-
solved.

27 Closing scrutiny of the proposed reciprocal-sum proof

The attempt ended by auditing its candidate proof of Erdős’s reciprocal-sum conjecture. Its target re-
mained

𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪𝑘 𝑁(log 𝑁)−3,

where 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) is the largest size of a subset of an interval of length 𝑁 without a nonconstant 𝑘-term arith-
metic progression. Dyadic summation would then force every such progression-free set to have conver-
gent reciprocal sum.

Closing checks examined whether shifted polynomial nilsequence paths retained the filtration needed
for degree reduction after normalization and quotienting. They revisited conditional moment inequali-

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

25

ties, Chinese remainder theorem comparisons, rational lattices, constrained aﬀine sampling, and poten-
tially circular parameter choices. A correction used pigeonholing to obtain a common cube slice from
short-axis choices.

Batching density increments risked excessive rank growth. With 𝑝0 a logarithmic inverse-density scale
and 𝐺 a fixed density-gain factor, the proposed packet-rank bound was 𝐶𝐺(2 + 𝑝0)𝐷𝑠, with exponent
independent of 𝐺. The assistant calculated that repeating 𝑂(log 𝑝0) packets would preserve polynomial
rank, letting density gain exceed the loss when nilsequence decomposition reset the patch to an interval
progression. The assistant checked for hidden dependence that could defeat this calculation.

The assistant rechecked the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem’s dimension and Lipschitz bounds
for its nilsequence correlations [36], and the progression decomposition in their quantitative Szemerédi
paper for resetting patches [35].
It also examined the relative-density and regularity hypotheses of
Bloom–Sisask Bohr almost-periodicity in the degree-one comparison [4]. Its final response presented
the proposed argument.

Part II: The quasipolynomial strengthening

Original prompt (excerpts)

# Problem

Please give quasipolynomial bounds for k-th arithmetic progressions for all k>=3. Use the previous
bounds you have done.

28 The stronger target and the cost of precision

The assistant seeks 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≤ 𝐶𝑘𝑁 exp(−𝑐𝑘(log 𝑁)𝑐𝑘), equivalently a threshold 𝑁 ≥ exp(𝑝𝐶𝑘) at density
𝑒−𝑝. Starting from the earlier argument, it isolates a quantitative obstruction: relative lifting adds patch
ranks, but repeatedly raises logarithmic resource bounds to a fixed power. The recurrences

𝐻𝑗+1 = 𝜅𝐻2
𝑗 ,

𝑃𝑗+1 = 𝑃𝑗 + (2 + 𝑃𝑗)𝐸

amplify density rapidly while still giving log 𝑃𝑗 ≪ 𝐸𝑗 log(2 + 𝑝).

Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s inverse theorem [36] supplies nilsequence structure, and their progression
partition [35] resets a positive patch score to an ordinary density increment.
Schoen–Sisask’s
radius-sensitive almost-periodicity, Theorem 5.4 [49], and Bloom–Sisask’s Theorem 17 [4] support the
degree-one comparison; Bohr widths must be tracked separately from rank.

The assistant seeks constant-factor growth of logarithmic resources through 𝑂(log 𝑝) levels; a factor
𝑝𝐶 per level would already exceed its budget. Structured positive models offer another route, but smaller
counting errors could enlarge their complexity. It returns to positive grids and bilinear kernels.

The assistant isolated the difference between additive rank growth and repeated precision loss. The ear-
lier lifting argument returned at most 𝑑+𝑑0 slots from 𝑑 old slots, but could replace a logarithmic budget
𝑃 by (2+𝑃)𝐸. Preparing and freezing successive weights controlled one lifting operation; iterating whole
operations still threatened the desired threshold exp((log(1/𝛼))𝑂𝑘(1)).

It explored local inverse theorems normalized by patch mass, tensor amplification, reductions to
shorter progressions, and multidimensional aﬀine boxes. Tensor products multiplied the density loss,

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

26

while carry avoidance spoiled the apparent economy of sphere constructions. Kelley–Meka’s large-
moment method [33] inspired polynomial-size grid ideas, but binary cubes did not themselves contain
the needed progression. Retaining box volume looked promising for linear Bohr sets; quadratic mixed-
coeﬀicient constraints appeared to consume that advantage.

Encoding precision in unrestricted coeﬀicients introduces unwanted integer branches. Auxiliary slots
do not exclude them automatically. Height-independent lattice charts suggest treating continuous and
discrete directions separately, while the assistant continues seeking density gains without repeatedly
powering the old precision budget.

The assistant seeks to separate the precision needed inside scalar transfer from the complexity of its
output patch. In the earlier argument, slot counts remain additive, but residue slicing, lattice heights,
and torus-cell selection feed old precision into new widths and scores. The desired replacement would
charge those costs to side lengths while shrinking old residual coordinates only by exp(−𝑝𝑂(1)).

It explores normalized polynomial tubes, generic-path independence, and degree-stratified losses. The
quantitative benchmarks are Szemerédi’s theorem and Gowers’s proof [50, 13], together with Green–
Tao, Kelley–Meka, and Leng–Sah–Sawhney [17, 33, 35]. Entropy, high moments, and simultaneous
increments suggest possible alternatives to repeatedly conditioning on tiny cells, but no suitable global
model is obtained. Seminorm modelling with the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem [36] and cube
lifting supplied by OpenAI in Monochromatic finite sums and products in the positive integers [46], in the
Host–Kra framework [27], motivate further transfer ideas.

Tensor powers dilute gains; translated intersections fail to align differences; latent coordinates in-
troduce vertical progressions. The assistant seeks large internal dependence on old precision 𝑄 with
output-width costs polynomial in 𝑝.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Height encoded but pre-precision governs occupancy; to target a rare high-density cell cannot
ignore tiny mass for detection/global inverse. Could use full old complexity in proof of
existence/globalization without incurring it in output patch Lip!

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Need domains retain structure for each of O(p) increments at cost exp(-p^C) factor independent of
old precision.

29 Normalized symbols and relative lifting

The assistant sought a two-budget strengthening of the earlier lifting mechanism: new density gains
should cost poly(𝑝) even when old chart widths are 𝑒−𝑄, with 𝑄 ≫ 𝑝. Substitutions, sampling, and
entropy models threatened degree, scale, and intersection control. The reference framework retained
Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s inverse and partition results [36, 35], Schoen–Sisask almost-periodicity [49],
Bloom–Sisask’s three-term comparison [4], and Kelley–Meka’s multiplicative increment perspec-
tive [33].

A possible separation appeared when a degree-ℎ chart was tested by degree-𝑟 functions with 𝑟 < ℎ.
The assistant proposed using independence of polynomial tensors on cube grids to transfer normal-
ized correlations. A signed dense model with cap 𝑒poly(𝑝), obtained through quadratic rather than high-
product comparisons, might avoid the costs of a model bounded by one; Conlon–Fox–Zhao’s relative-
removal framework [7] was a point of comparison. For 𝑟 ≥ ℎ, dependencies among constrained cube
vertices blocked the same argument.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

27

The assistant then seeks a shadow domain where the narrow chart has bounded width. Pulling in-
crements back would require matching slow, rational, and fast statistics while preserving integrality,
boundedness, progression counts, and joint laws.

The assistant sought to widen a tube |𝐶ℎ(𝑢) − 𝛽| ≤ 𝑒−𝑄 while preserving its normalized polynomial
statistics. Such a shadow might make the earlier relative-lifting framework usable with losses controlled
by density rather than accumulated precision. Doubling chains connected local identities to integral
endpoints. Altering denominators raised congruence and product constraints.

Marginal face-symmetry lifts supplied by OpenAI in Monochromatic finite sums and products in the positive
integers [46] suggested randomized joint shears, still obstructed by rational periods.

It then tried to keep internal algebraic matching at fine precision while returning a coarser test. Large
rational slopes could restore precision feedback. Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse-theorem models [36] did
not automatically avoid that loss.

Direct counting on highest-degree factors borrowed positive comparison from Kelley–Meka [33]. The
assistant found that variation in lower coordinates could encode four-term coloring problems. Positive
models faced clipping costs.

The assistant targets 𝑂(𝑝) fixed increments with additive width losses and linear rank growth. Green–
Tao’s local 𝑈3 inverse method [18] and four-term bound [17] suggested a derivative-based route, but
integrating those derivatives through sparse tubes remained unresolved.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Violation cannot be distributed; amplification pointed from first slow requirement to endpoint. So
simultaneous realization fails even approximate.

The assistant tried to preserve a useful density gain while confining old precision costs to a separate
cold budget. Here the warm budget tracks the less expensive width losses, while the cold budget tracks
more expensive algebraic costs. Instead of freezing a local test on tiny slices, it proposed a hybrid 𝐸𝑃𝑅:
a slow real factor, an ambient polynomial map, and a rational residue factor. The propagation archi-
tecture from the previous argument, the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem [36], and Leng’s eﬀicient
equidistribution theorem [37] supplied the contemplated detector and symbol-reduction tools.

Factoring the ambient map suggests replacing its fast state by an independent Haar variable. Simul-
taneously treating old constraints might limit added coordinates to the new local group. The assistant
still needs globalization preserving weighted degree and positive score.

Composition can increase weighted degree, while residue representatives may require one new coor-
dinate per old variable. The assistant seeks periodic outputs, then considers degree 𝑠2 and averaging
away coordinates above 𝑠. Positivity and the rank cost of high-weight residue slots remain obstacles.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Real mesh of u can be in slice cost only; width of y_h determined by chart-relative smooth
derivatives e^{poly(p)} if t-slice simple.

30 Aﬀine restrictions and degree control

The assistant allows ambient degree 𝐷 ≈ 𝑠2 with detector degree 𝑠 = 𝑘 − 2. Positive conditional av-
eraging would remove high-weight coordinates. Aﬀine-plane inverses, Hensel lifting, and the Chinese
remainder theorem might preserve the test group without adding residue slots for every old coordinate.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

28

The unresolved issue was simultaneous preparation. Processing old layers separately could yield 𝑠2𝐷
>
𝐷, defeating a fixed degree bound. The assistant returned to the sampler, fixed-group globalization, and
descending rank potential of the previous argument, seeking losses independent of old widths.

The recalled benchmarks were Gowers, Green–Tao, Bloom–Sisask, and Kelley–Meka [13, 17, 3, 33,
5]; inverse and partition inputs were Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s general and five-term work [36, 35, 39].
Nilsequence and positive-comparison foundations were attributed to Green–Tao, Green–Tao–Ziegler,
Schoen–Sisask, and Bloom–Sisask [23, 22, 49, 4]. Historical density, prime, and coloring results were
attributed to Erdős–Turán, Szemerédi, Green–Tao, and van der Waerden [10, 11, 50, 20, 51].

The assistant sought to replace repeated polynomial resource growth by a hierarchy of width bud-
gets. Reviewing the machinery of the previous argument, it contrasted the manageable rank recurrence
𝑅𝑗 = 2𝑗𝑝𝑂(1) with 𝑃𝑗+1 = 𝑃𝑗 + (2 + 𝑃𝑗)𝐸. The reset based on Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s nilsequence de-
composition [35] made dimension especially important: its progression-length exponent deteriorated
polynomially with dimension.

Finite-field and box models lose density when preventing wraparound. The assistant instead
processes constraints by increasing weight, retaining top-weight coordinates and charging precision
to lower determining coordinates. Added coordinates would flow downward through finitely many
weights, but their total rank still needs control.

Tiny higher-layer support can concentrate scores on rare paths, defeating normalized-density esti-
mates. Replacing 𝐸(𝜃)ℎ𝐷(𝜃) by weighted polynomial factors also needs uniformity in unbounded ℎ. Av-
eraging additional coordinates suggests a route, with lattice covariance and dimension still unresolved.

The assistant focused on preserving rank while replacing local tests by ambient ones. The earlier
triangular-patch conversion separates unrestricted coeﬀicients from kernel precision and rank. Re-
cursive amplification seemed affordable in rank, but repeated path-length losses could turn a fixed
polynomial budget into 𝑝𝐶 log 𝑝. Constant increments therefore required additive or strictly hierarchical
rank growth.

For a hybrid test 𝐹(𝐸(𝜃)𝑃(𝑢, 𝛽)𝑅(𝜃)), the desired replacement would eliminate 𝜃 without increasing
weighted degree or introducing slots for bounded representatives of the fast variable. Large lattice shifts
and small continuous smoothing were explored, but transferring the resulting arbitrary test required
conditional distribution estimates with potentially circular precision costs. Symbol reduction used the
framework of Leng’s eﬀicient equidistribution theorem [37] and the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theo-
rem [36].

Reduction modulo 𝐵(𝜃) − 𝑋 suggests comparing exact fibers with coarse neighborhoods uniformly
in the fast variable. Products recreate eliminated components, and subpower Fourier decay does not
give summable tails. The assistant therefore revisits relative strength and independent product-block
estimates.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

At depth log p yields p^{C log p}. Need avoid using amplified rule recursively (side length
multiplication). Thus constant increment iteration only: rank growth must be additive/hierarchical,
widths same.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Could use Hensel linearization of polynomial map along some structured affine subspace of t to
right-inverse low-coordinate variables as genuine linear polynomials with rational coefficients mod
M plus small-modulus restrictions.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

31 Separating internal precision from output width

The assistant compares exact fibers 𝐵(𝜃) = 𝑋 with coarse neighborhoods under tests 𝐹(𝑔(𝜃, ℎ)Γ) uniform
in ℎ. Coupling between blocks defeats independence. Fiber ideals, oscillatory estimates, and aﬀine
sampling face recreated product terms and integer denominators.

Using the symbol and globalization framework of the previous argument, it next considered a smoothed
model 𝐸(𝑋)𝐽(ℎ)𝑅(𝑋). A candidate depending on latent ℎ still had to become a polynomial expression
in the actual variables. Preserving that projection became a central requirement.

The surrounding quantitative benchmarks were Szemerédi [50], Gowers [13], Green–Tao [17], Kelley–
Meka [33], and Leng–Sah–Sawhney [35]. The assistant sought to avoid repeated losses by retaining
passive old constraints and transforming only active low-degree data. A finite palette with 𝐽 layers
might replace repeated multiplication by layer weights with 𝑟 ↦ 𝑂(𝑟2), giving a cap 𝑠2𝐽
. The final idea
preserved a dependency graph between levels. Rank-preparation downgrades, integer carries, and short
parameter directions remained obstacles to closing that scheme.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Cannot tensor independence B blocks with arbitrary nf test coupling all blocks. But can
Cauchy-Schwarz and apply high-rank inverse estimate with dimensions m huge; exponent degrades
poly(m), rank maybe enough but circular.

Separating active variables from passive masks still permits 𝑅𝑖 ≃ 𝑅2

𝑖+1. The assistant proposes simul-

taneous preparation by effective degree, charging rank failures to lower-layer widths.

Cube comparison, detection, and strong-projection refiltration from the reciprocal-sum argument
supplied the starting mechanisms. The assistant also reconsidered Conlon–Fox–Zhao relative transfer-
ence [7], Kelley–Meka boosting [33], and shift comparison with its Schoen–Sisask almost-periodicity
input [49]; these did not resolve the dependence on old chart precision.

Intermediate integer directions are too expensive to freeze and too short for approximation. Linear
sampling recovers parameters but leaves path-dependent translations. Fixing them introduces deriva-
tive constraints; polynomial families instead encounter refiltration across different sites. The assistant
returns to fixed translations.

Expanding 𝛽𝑖(𝑥 + 𝑉𝑡) = ∑|𝛼|≤𝑖 𝑏𝑖,𝛼(𝑥)𝑡𝛼 lowers coeﬀicient weights to 𝑖 − |𝛼|. The assistant seeks down-
ward dimension flow, but conditional rank and density need control. Simultaneous sampling may again
charge narrow lower widths to higher layers.

The main alternative was algebraic elimination. For a smoothed model 𝑃∗ = Φ(𝑋, ℎ), a replacement
depending on latent ℎ would not automatically transfer to the original variables. The assistant sought
a multiplicative substitution 𝐿 satisfying 𝐿(𝐵(𝑡)) = 𝑋, preserving slow-factor bounds, rational denom-
inators, and nilpotent reconstruction identities. The assistant considered Ananyan–Hochster, Stillman,
and strength ideas as possible approaches to this substitution [1].

Detection continued to use Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36]; its dimension
dependence created a potential circularity between partner complexity and sampler strength. The earlier
lifting framework supplied the structural starting point. Simultaneously respecting real smallness and
rational integrality remained the central diﬀiculty. The assistant continues comparing these elimination
routes and their cumulative costs.

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

30

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Need handle macro elimination on integer fibers.

32 The problem of repeatedly returning to intervals

The assistant seeks relative comparison independent of scale: additive rank alone cannot prevent re-
peated precision losses from defeating 𝑁 ≥ exp(𝑝𝑂(1)).

It revisited the counting and lifting mechanism of the earlier reciprocal-sum argument. The recurrence
𝐻𝑗+1 = 𝜅𝐻2
𝑗 amplifies gain, but 𝑃𝑗+1 = 𝑃𝑗 + (2 + 𝑃𝑗)𝐸 compounds resources. Proposed alternatives
included direct comparison on normalized thin patches, a hierarchy of residual widths, averaging en-
riched cells, and digit-box embeddings. Rare-cell mass losses, spherical layers, and integer carries frus-
trated these routes; no scale-independent replacement was completed. Each proposal still needed uni-
form control before later sampling parameters were chosen.

The reviewed historical context comprised Erdős–Turán, Szemerédi, Erdős’s reciprocal-sum question,
Green–Tao on primes, Green’s survey, and van der Waerden [10, 50, 11, 20, 25, 51]. Quantitative bench-
marks were Gowers, Green–Tao, Bloom–Sisask, Kelley–Meka, and Leng–Sah–Sawhney [13, 17, 3, 33, 4, 5,
39, 35]. Nilmanifold equidistribution, inverse theorems, and almost-periodicity supplied the structural
background [23, 22, 49, 36]. The assistant’s closing direction was to seek a larger density gain at fixed
degree without repeatedly conditioning on exceptionally small cells.

The assistant revisited the earlier reciprocal-sum argument’s sampling, lattice-chart, and lifting founda-
tions. Rank preparation lowers the potential ∑ℎ ℎ dim 𝑊ℎ, but this dimension accounting alone does
not control the precision costs of successive density increments. Inactive integer projection coordinates
were the main obstruction: their bounded ranges prevent polynomial variation along arbitrarily long
paths.

Fixing a lattice sheet simplifies identities but makes thresholds depend on covolume. Positive char-
acter tests cannot isolate it cheaply. Keeping sheet variables requires replacement tests to use partner
information from one ambient site; dummy variables and shadow models do not resolve this.

Full shear groups could repeatedly replace rank by a polynomial. The assistant separates orientation
from approximation: relation rows remain bounded at original resolution, while denominators depend
on conditional mass. Sampling frequencies may still enlarge those rows, motivating separate ensembles
or scales.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

We need decisive simplification. Let's attempt direct path selection global via *exact polynomial
maps on high-rank varieties* and L map applied to cold globalization without macro separate.

Short integer directions can remain family parameters, but differentiation risks rank feedback. Produc-
tive paths may carry only a tiny fraction of mass. The assistant seeks prefix-by-prefix mass comparisons
that survive globalization.

Kelley–Meka’s degree-one method [33] motivated another examination of concentration removal, con-
cave potentials, and matched local scales. The earlier reciprocal-sum argument’s relative-lifting and
refiltration mechanisms offered additive rank, but still allowed old widths to drive subsequent complex-
ity.

For short-parameter families, the proposed repair used evaluation pivots and filtration slack. Its un-
resolved point was reconstructing all marked functions at one common spatial site when pivot relations

involved different sites. Freezing sheets was also costly: for 𝐶 = (𝑃, 𝐵𝑃), fixing 𝑏′ − 𝐵𝑏 can impose a
width of order 1/𝐵 on the fractional part of 𝑃.

Enlarged domains, finite-field models, and surrogate laws leave a recurring obstacle: tiny structured

correlations do not force alignment on short paths.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Old slot complexity maybe rank O(poly(p)) widths tiny exp(-poly(p)); losses in outputs depending
old widths lead runaway recursion.

33 Constrained sampling and scalar transfer

The assistant rejects an ultraproduct shortcut because 𝑝𝐶𝐸𝑗
does not give a uniform exponent. A factor-
ization stable in conditional total variation would tolerate oscillatory tests, but higher-degree constraints
and tiny residual coeﬀicients obstruct polynomial transversality.

Using the step-drop framework of the earlier reciprocal-sum argument, with antecedents in Leng’s eﬀi-
cient equidistribution theorem [37] and Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s degree reduction [36], it proposed split-
ting integer outputs into long directions and short coordinates 𝑧. Extracting the least short-weight term
𝑧𝛼𝐷𝛼 was intended to sharpen slow bounds without allowing narrow earlier widths to enlarge rational
denominators. Rank failures would then move downward in degree.

A test variable 𝜁 and family variable 𝑧′ permit a marked-data correction that vanishes on the diagonal
and preserves the leading long-variable symbol. The assistant seeks recursive degree reduction with
diagonal reconstruction, while checking degree caps, constant terms, and productive mass.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

To show there exists c>0 all N, need uniform exponent, cannot overspill with varied E.

The assistant developed an aﬀine-section approach within the earlier reciprocal-sum argument’s sam-
pling and modular-forecasting framework. For inactive coordinates it proposed retaining the degree-ℎ
product blocks while adding a free linear variable. Fixing the product variables would then make exact
inversion possible without sacrificing the leading-degree structure.

Active outputs need many aﬀine sections with controlled incidence. Exceptional probabilities can
swamp tiny scores, while increasing dimension risks circularity. Independent coeﬀicients on disjoint
columns, second moments, and nonsingular Hensel lifting suggest weights bounded everywhere and
near one outside exceptional residues.

The assistant tests 𝑓 1good, using mixed centers to protect mass and truncated inclusion–exclusion to
replace primewise masks by bounded-modulus tests. Degree relaxation threatens passive-layer separa-
tion, prompting another examination of warm detection and signed models.

The assistant sought to prevent narrow old charts from making each density increment polynomially
more expensive than its predecessor. Starting from the earlier reciprocal-sum lifting mechanism, it pro-
posed a buffered invariant

𝔼𝑓 𝐵strict ≥ 𝑎 𝔼𝐵buffer.

This would protect positive mass from tangencies to chart boundaries. Passive determining masks
would remain ambient functions; active ones would be preserved exactly by a marked projection while
new coordinates alone acquired larger degree. The recalled progression-reset comparison with Leng–

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

Sah–Sawhney [35] motivated this stricter accounting.

A signed dense-model approach then encountered a circularity: improving approximation enlarged
the model cap, and the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem [36] could return a correlation smaller than
the approximation error. An 𝐿2 model merely shifted the diﬀiculty to truncation.

Drawing on Conlon–Fox–Zhao densification [7], the assistant proposed replacing non-root cube fac-
tors sequentially by bounded signs of conditional dual functions. Weighted grid estimates would pre-
serve correlation; after only the root remained sparse, bounded duals could be replaced successively by
niltests using the ordinary inverse theorem. This was intended to detect the root without simultaneously
matching a large test family.

A further proposed free linear parameter would make inactive integer outputs invertible after freez-
ing nonlinear parameters. The assistant continued checking rank preparation, buffered normalization,
boundary estimates, and the quantitative savings.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Absence of AP is global strong deficit, requires correlation affecting almost all f or severe
concentration.

34 Rank preparation and layered width budgets

The assistant reopened the earlier reciprocal-sum argument’s sampler and globalization machinery. For
constraints 𝐶ℎ − 𝑐ℎ = 𝑦ℎ + 𝛽ℎ, detection bounds had to be fixed before the sampling length, rank thresh-
old, and subspace heights entered. The rereading emphasized height-independent lattice charts, the
distinction between abstract coeﬀicient normalization and normalization of the actual tilted law, and
cube-image errors controlled by total mass rather than a large density supremum.

Globalization selected polynomially many significant top-frequency pivots, approximated masked
inputs uniformly over path-dependent tests, and reconstructed exact marked projections through lower-
degree induction. Yet amplification still paid

𝐻𝑗+1 = 𝜅𝐻2
𝑗 ,

𝑃𝑗+1 = 𝑃𝑗 + (2 + 𝑃𝑗)𝐸,

so repeated polynomial resource composition limited the useful depth. The reset relied on Leng–Sah–
Sawhney’s Improved Bounds for Szemerédi’s Theorem, Lemma 2.1 [35], to convert positive nilsequence score
into a long-progression density increment.

The assistant therefore sought a recurrence linear in old resources, or a normalized weighted-major
decomposition avoiding repeated powers of thin chart widths. A recalled macro-transfer route also con-
sidered the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem [36], with weighted-degree and discretization diﬀicul-
ties. Revisited candidates included preparing constraints globally by effective degree, treating high tags
as passive, allowing bounded degree overshoot, and substituting low tags through aﬀine fibers. The as-
sistant identifies simultaneous preparation, residue periodicity, normalized transfer, and repeated rank
growth as obstacles to these candidates.

Inactive directions can be too short for symbol matching yet too costly to freeze. Polynomial families
need common reconstruction, and lattice sheets risk circular dependence between rank thresholds and
covolumes.

It revisited the rank-preparation and constrained-sampling mechanisms of the earlier reciprocal-sum
argument. Moving a removed direction from tag ℎ to ℎ−1 decreases ∑ℎ ℎ dim 𝑊ℎ, bounding the number

Quasipolynomial bounds for arithmetic progressions

33

of failures. Solving all relation rows at a tag jointly was intended to avoid repeated height exponentiation.
Extending this bookkeeping to changing lower-layer charts remained unresolved.

Strict and buffered boxes satisfy 𝔼𝑓 1strict ≥ 𝑎𝔼1buffer. Their gap protects against tangency during
refinements. Mixing feasible centers should normalize chart mass and retain productive paths, while
non-site Fourier modes and torus covers still require treatment.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Instead of replacing B with selecting chart cells immediately, insert new slots with unrestricted
centers and update evaluation map candidate masks. Need measure concentrations only after prep
complete.

The assistant investigated whether global rank preparation could preserve relative patch widths without
charging narrow lower layers to higher ones. Using the earlier reciprocal-sum argument’s triangular-
patch, polynomial-image, modular-exception, and pathwise-detection machinery, it sought a failed-rank
decomposition into a slow polynomial, a rational polynomial with controlled denominator, and a lower-
degree remainder.

The assistant separates real bounds in normalized residual coordinates from rational denominators
independent of lower widths. Formal-slot descent suggests subtracting slow and rational terms sepa-
rately. Short axes and spatial rescaling motivate degree induction and modular nondegeneracy before
pigeonholing.

Translated boxes preserve fixed strict/buffer margins. Rank removal moves directions downward
while retaining exact higher substitutions. A two-variable family correction preserves the common-site
projection on the diagonal; the assistant checks compatibility when additional axes become short.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Maybe choose W full always (avoid inactive) by keeping lowered directions as independent
coordinates but altering polynomial to generic high-rank perturbations?

35 A triangular density-increment proposal

The assistant refined a layered density-increment scheme using the earlier reciprocal-sum foundations.
It found that restoring a polynomial map through a quotient section could destroy the required regular-
ity. Its proposed repair postponed all kernel-translation averages until after scalar transfer and aﬀine-
plane inversion, imposing regularity only on the averaged bottom-level test.

The assistant retains modular good flags to protect tiny scores, using truncated inclusion–exclusion
over small prime products. Free linear parameters invert inactive integer coordinates; aﬀine sections
and real smoothing address normalization and boundaries.

For passive layers, the assistant proposed densifying a sparse cube average one vertex at a time before
applying Leng, Sah and Sawhney’s quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36] to bounded dual functions.
This avoided directly inverting a function with the large cap imposed by a narrow chart. The resulting
strict/buffered patch certificate was 𝔼𝑓 𝐵− > 𝑎𝔼𝐵+. The intended bookkeeping let dimensions grow from
higher blocks and each logarithmic width loss depend only on higher widths. The assistant calculated
that, with those preparation and transfer bounds, repeated constant multiplicative increments would
yield the desired quasipolynomial progression bound.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Cannot ensure at least many V for all t if B level set singular at some t. Flags needed.

The assistant tried to keep rationality costs from becoming width losses. Using the earlier reciprocal-
sum machinery, it separated bounded real inverse substitution from denominator control by exceptional
prime powers. The recalled detector used Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36]
for ambient nilsequence partners.

Sharpening slow-plus-rational splitting precedes expansion in excluded coordinates. Degree induc-
tion should cancel side losses without iterating once per coordinate. Tensor terms require separate exact
agreement; constants use pigeonholing. Rank failures move downward, and translated boxes preserve
surplus.

Aﬀine sections satisfy 𝑏(𝑥 + 𝑉(𝑠, ℎ), 𝑟0 + ℎ) = 𝑏(𝑥, 𝑟0) + 𝑠. Plane-invariant selection and nonsingular
lifts should give near-one weights outside rare flags. Forecasting truncates flag inclusion–exclusion by
small witness moduli to retain terminal paths.

Backward lifting keeps passive masks as site functions and active projections exact. Actual and
dummy short variables support corrections. Representative selection waits until averaging supplies
smoothness and periodicity; bounded active degree inflation should close the hierarchy.

The assistant separated its forward construction from the backward globalization still to be supplied.
Using the earlier reciprocal-sum foundations, it sought to iterate certificates 𝔼𝑓 𝐵− > 𝑎𝔼𝐵+ for strict and
buffered polynomial patches. The crucial requirement was that the loss in 𝑄𝑖 = log(2/𝑤𝑖) depend on
higher widths, not on 𝑄𝑖 itself; descending induction would then control 𝑂(log(1/𝑎)) increments.

Normalized residuals control slow coeﬀicients separately from exceptional denominator factors.
Failed relations move lower-degree remainders downward while preserving exact higher substitutions.
Shifted coverings are intended to protect surplus without inverse-mass losses.

Scalar transfer retains inactive parameters while duplicating parallel ones into real and residue vari-
ables. Aﬀine planes and nonsingular lifts control modular flags through bounded witness moduli. The
assistant obtains a forward fraction 𝑐𝑎 of productive terminal paths and turns to restoring their gain
backwards.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Any mid axes v newly short after choosing later threshold; restricted symbols pure-long independent
their values because g has deg≤layer in v, so discarded v only lowers.

36 Globalizing the active and passive layers

The assistant inspected the earlier reciprocal-sum machinery, concentrating on exact projections and
costs that must remain independent of later sampling scales. Globalization selects a basis of significant
top frequencies, attaches ambient partners through uniform masked-input approximation, and inter-
sects rational fast algebras. Injectivity at the top permits reconstruction through

Slow and rational factors require corrections in the actual kernel, followed by compatible lattice refine-
ments and controlled nets of the resulting test families.

Polynomial translation groups connect symbolic factorization to slow-plus-rational decomposition.
The sampler tracks coeﬀicient normalization, spatial equidistribution, and residues. Scalar transfer dis-
counts good-prime density factors and postpones orientation costs until recovery.

The assistant keeps passive masks external and active slots exactly marked. It must preserve higher
widths through candidate replacement, congruences, and degree changes. Same-weight dependencies
wait until final descent; it next checks these inherited estimates.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Major issue replacing candidates (globalization) without consuming w_j. For active j layers r maybe
high, detection cold in Q_j; symbolic lifting uses P_j coefficients unconstrained; want paired
score width lower at j = w_j exp(-poly(warm)), at all >j same.

The assistant audited the earlier reciprocal-sum machinery, including the use of Leng–Sah–Sawhney’s
quasipolynomial inverse theorem [36]. It checked cube-count normalization, path-dependent detection,
weighted densification, and clipping of separating functionals. The guiding concern was whether nar-
row current-layer widths could contaminate bounds meant to depend only on higher-weight data.

The modular audit permits bounded products of witness prime powers, avoiding one oversized mod-
ulus. It checks coeﬀicient independence, real/grid perturbations, sublevel depths, primitive-lattice de-
nominators, and preservation of additive rank 𝑑 + 𝑑0.

For a passive layer 𝑗 > 𝑠, degree prevented the new degree-𝑠 symbol from involving degree-𝑗 lift
variables. The proposed globalization first obtained a decomposition with width-dependent bounds,
then sharpened it through long spatial columns and sequential modular filters. To preserve signed
scores, it tracked both nonnegative components of

(𝑓 𝐿−)Φ− − 𝜆𝐿+Φ+,

using finite nets of site-dependent fields. The remaining passive-transfer plan removed good-prime
density factors through 1 + 𝑂(𝑝−2) estimates while retaining exceptional primes and stride divisors.
The assistant then turns from these parameter choices to the ascent.

Inactive columns and continuous pivots reduce reconstruction to constraints in 𝑋 = (𝑢, 𝛽). Boundary
strips are removed only from positive terms; short integer ranges retain exact membership. Smooth-cell
averaging should then produce a parent certificate.

For active layers, selected aﬀine planes give 𝑥 = 𝑎+𝑉(𝐵, 𝑟). The assistant argues that bounded total plane
measure permits selection without a loss depending on the huge modulus. Exact periodicity under
changing residue representatives is essential. The nilpotent-degree induction uses polynomial families
in short variables, significant vertical Fourier modes, and central averaging. Its symbol-splitting and
reconstruction inputs come from the earlier reciprocal-sum argument.

Correlation subslices identify symbols without altering the objective slice. The assistant separates final
thresholds from later induction and unions over individual approximants to avoid excessive complexity.
It checks projections and periodicity recursively, while still needing to preserve the widths on already
processed layers.

37 Iterating with separate degree budgets

The assistant proposed a downward iteration preserving a signed, full-box-mass score, drawing on the
earlier reciprocal-sum argument. Paired smooth cutoffs allowed small target discounts to absorb cover-
age losses, while old determining equations remained exact.

Passive layers use a common ambient orbit and retained modulus. Active layers use stochastic re-
placements with short-variable polynomial labels, common-input correction, refiltration, and fiber re-
construction. Only expected evaluations must be independent of residue representatives.

Extraction solves inactive coordinates, removes determinant and boundary exceptions, and uses aﬀine
residue sections. Averaging fixes constants while preserving surplus; spatial cells restore two cutoffs
with inflation confined to absolute slots.

The assistant claimed a recurrence in which the logarithmic width cost at each layer depends polyno-

mially on higher-layer widths, permitting 𝑂𝑘(1 + 𝑝) increments and the bound

𝑟𝑘(𝑁)/𝑁 ≤ 𝑂𝑘(1) exp(−𝑐𝑘(log 𝑁)1/𝐶𝑘).

It then reopened the argument for detailed scrutiny, particularly sparse-cube densification, warm-cost
detection and the sharpening of the major decomposition needed to avoid feeding excessive preliminary
costs into width losses.

The assistant worked out how a positive density surplus could survive the return from sampled paths.
Using the reciprocal-sum foundations, it distinguished inexpensive “warm” width losses from more ex-
pensive “cold” algebraic costs. Relation removal descended through weighted layers, introduced lower
coordinate copies, and preserved higher integer arguments by exact substitution.

A comparison measure separates real and residue copies while retaining inactive parameters. Prime
flags and aﬀine-plane counts avoid the full combined modulus. Passive globalization remains ordinary;
active replacements use short-variable families, vertical-frequency quotients, and common-site correc-
tions. Representative independence concerns expected payoffs.

Selected aﬀine planes then parameterized residue matching by 𝑥 = 𝑎 + 𝑉(𝐵, 𝑟). Positive averaging
fixed the remaining parameters; small boxes restored the determining constraints exactly. The assistant
claimed that bounded weight inflation and controlled width losses closed a multiplicative density in-
crement, hence a quasipolynomial iteration. Its subsequent rereading of the foundations retained the
conditional shift-comparison input and the additive relative-rank requirement 𝑑 + 𝑑0, rather than treat-
ing a merely polynomial rank bound as interchangeable.

The assistant audited the sampling and globalization foundations of the earlier reciprocal-sum argu-
ment, with particular attention to repeated width losses. Its proposed accounting charged substantial
refinements to strictly lower layers, leaving a rank cut’s own width loss independent of its rank thresh-
old.

The proposed decomposition 𝐷1 = 𝑆(𝑢/(𝐻𝑎𝜁 ), (𝑏 − 𝐴(𝑢))/(𝑣𝜁 𝑗)) + 𝑅(𝑢, 𝑏) separates real interpola-
tion from denominator control. Here 𝑆 is the slowly varying polynomial written in normalized spatial
and residual coordinates, while 𝑅 is the rational polynomial whose denominators must be controlled.
The factors 𝐻𝑎𝜁 and 𝑣𝜁 𝑗 set the normalization scales. Degree induction recovers short directions. Back-
ward lifting requires exact tensor separation because coeﬀicients are unrestricted; constant tensors use
pigeonholing.

Failed relations reduce weight-ℎ space and may add weight-ℎ − 1 blocks. Exact substitutions propa-
gate upward; shifted coverings preserve surplus. The assistant next checks frequency selection, patch

38 Auditing density detection and family parameters

The assistant scrutinized the forecasting and globalization machinery inherited from the earlier
reciprocal-sum argument. Its analytic inputs included the Leng–Sah–Sawhney inverse theorem [36]
and Leng’s eﬀicient equidistribution theorem [37], used in the proposed step-drop framework.

Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz duplicates grid variables and requires sparse boundary control. Modular
Fourier decay is truncated by individual character order to avoid one large modulus. Scalar forecasts
combine densities, congruences, and exact inactive constraints, with errors fixed before the prime cutoff.
A common top symbol need not give a common marked map after freezing short variables. The
assistant constructs a diagonal-identity correction preserving pure-long symbols and aligning dummy
projections at one input. Kernel corrections, lattice covers, and family nets follow; pure-long threshold
comparisons precede charges for new short lengths.

The assistant audited the proposed bound 𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪𝑘 𝑁 exp(−𝑐𝑘(log 𝑁)𝑐′
𝑘) by following weighted de-
termining polynomials through sampling, symbol matching, and ascent. The earlier reciprocal-sum
foundations supplied the machinery being adapted. Separate residue moduli for different blocks were
intended to prevent lower-layer costs from contaminating higher-layer width bounds. Fixing a common
gap from an advance dimension estimate was meant to avoid circularity across density increments.

The key correction distinguished warm approximation from whole-box detection: the detector could
be large only relative to normalized chart measure. The proposed argument used a mean-one sparse
chart weight, bounded-grid linear-forms estimates, and weighted Cauchy–Schwarz to replace sparse
factors by bounded ones before applying inverse theory. The inherited niltest-to-Gowers estimate was
specifically attributed to Leng, Sah, and Sawhney, Lemma B.5 [36].

The assistant checks pivot densities, inactive constraints, and cube-image errors in normalized Haar
𝐿1, charging Fourier complexity to later scales. For passive globalization, degree 𝑑 < 𝑗 excludes weight-𝑗
arguments, suggesting sharper bounds from separation and modular goodness.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Cube comparison and dual Gowers bound might require all parameter sides sufficiently large
depending on pre complexity, especially very short \(t_I\) in active or passive paths.

The assistant made the iteration’s resource ordering more explicit, using the absolute increment, symbol
calculus, and sampling arguments from the previous bound. It revised the prime-power sublevel argu-
ment to use a degree-bounded number of variables, intermediate valuation depths, and a univariate
determinant test.

Forward sampling normalizes strict mass by feasible-center proportions. A stop before ℎ divides by
∏𝑖≥ℎ 𝑒𝑖; later discards divide by ∏𝑖>ℎ 𝑒𝑖. The assistant checks terminal density and modular flag thresh-
olds through second moments and derivatives.

After preparation cuts, the assistant regenerates samplers from the new root. Dimensions and cut
counts precede widths and accuracies. It concludes that 𝑄out
𝑗 ≤ 𝑞𝑗 + poly(𝑝, 𝑑∗, 𝑞>𝑗) excludes current
width from added losses and permits 𝑂𝑘(1 + 𝑝) rounds, while continuing to check circularity and sub-
stitutions.

Need flag bad probability \(\le c_* \mathbb E\phi +\epsilon\) with centers Haar, not c_*

39 The proposed quasipolynomial bound

The assistant closed its weighted-cell argument with a sustained audit of the loss hierarchy, using the
earlier reciprocal-sum argument. It clarified that canonical-lift identities were required only on the actual
orbit and exactly projected output; arbitrary group points instead retained independent site multipliers.
A common vertical Fourier expansion preserved the meshes used to group paths.

For transported residual boxes, it used

ℎ = 𝑟new
𝑟old

ℎ + 𝑟in − 𝑐 − err

and centered the new box near 𝑙ℎ + 𝑐 − 𝑙in, with errors much smaller than the old enlargement gap.
It examined possible excessive denominator growth, short-axis effects on symbols, and sparse-chart
normalization losses. It also specified that internal residue subdivisions disappear before the active
return, and that buffered charts remain comparable in radius with the current width.

The assistant presented the construction as its proposed proof. It asserted that 𝑝 ≍𝑘 2 + log(1/𝛼), a

fixed multiplicative density gain, and only 𝑂𝑘(1 + 𝑝) rounds yield
𝑟𝑘(𝑁) ≪𝑘 𝑁 exp(−𝑐𝑘(log 𝑁)𝑐′
𝑘)

when log 𝑁 exceeds a suitable polynomial in 𝑝. It also stated the equivalent quasipolynomial density
threshold and the coloring consequence obtained from a largest color class.
