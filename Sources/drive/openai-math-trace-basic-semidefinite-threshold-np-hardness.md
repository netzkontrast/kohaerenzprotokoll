BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

Summarized chain of thought (Ordinary NP-Hardness at the Basic
Semidefinite Threshold)

OpenAI

Original prompt (excerpts)

# Problem

Prove or refute the following ordinary NP-hardness assertion for the basic-SDP approximation
threshold of every fixed finite Max-CSP. The intended improvement is to obtain matching NP-hardness
without the Unique Games Conjecture. The deterministic inapproximability consequence, and the
interpretation of an algorithmic counterexample, use the assumption P != NP.

FIXED LANGUAGE AND FINITE INPUTS. Fix a nonempty finite alphabet D and a finite nonempty collection
Gamma of predicates f:D^(k_f)->{0,1}, with positive integer arities k_f. The alphabet, all
predicate truth tables, and k=max_f k_f are fixed independently of the input size; they are not
growing-alphabet or growing-arity parameters.

An instance I has finitely many variables x_1,...,x_n in D and a finite nonempty list of constraint
occurrences e=1,...,m. Discard unused variables and relabel the variables that occur as
x_1,...,x_n; thus n is at most the total number of argument positions in the listed constraints.
Occurrence e specifies f_e in Gamma, an ordered tuple (v_(e,1),...,v_(e,k_fe)) of variable indices,
and a positive rational weight w_e, with sum_e w_e=1. Variable indices may repeat within a tuple,
and different occurrences may have the same tuple or the same underlying scope. Rational numerators
and denominators and variable indices are encoded in binary. This weighted input convention is part
of the problem; zero-weight occurrences can be discarded before normalization. Unweighted instances
are the special case w_e=1/m.

For an assignment a:{1,...,n}->D define

val_I(a) = sum_e w_e f_e(a(v_(e,1)),...,a(v_(e,k_fe))),

and define OPT(I)=max_a val_I(a). Thus the objective is the normalized weight of satisfied
predicates. There is no promise that all constraints can be simultaneously satisfied.

THE BASIC SDP. Use the following specific relaxation, in the vector/local-distribution form of
Raghavendra's SDP(I) and its standard BasicSDP formulation. Let S_e be the set of distinct variable
indices appearing in occurrence e. Introduce real vectors u_0 and u_(v,d), for v in {1,...,n} and d
in D. Introduce a separate probability distribution mu_e on D^(S_e) for every constraint occurrence
e. Here beta in D^(S_e) means a map beta:S_e->D. Maximize

sum_e w_e sum_(beta in D^(S_e)) mu_e(beta)

f_e(beta(v_(e,1)),...,beta(v_(e,k_fe)))

subject to all of the following:

dot(u_0,u_0) = 1;
sum_(d in D) u_(v,d)=u_0 for each variable v;
dot(u_(v,d),u_(v,d')) = 0 for d != d';
mu_e(beta)>=0 and sum_beta mu_e(beta)=1 for every e;
dot(u_(v,d),u_(w,d'))

= sum_(beta: beta(v)=d, beta(w)=d') mu_e(beta)
for every e, v,w in S_e and d,d' in D, including v=w;

dot(u_(v,d),u_0)

= sum_(beta: beta(v)=d) mu_e(beta)
for every e, v in S_e and d in D.

Here dot denotes the real inner product. The vectors have a common finite-dimensional real
inner-product space; equivalently their Gram matrix is positive semidefinite. Dimension n|D|+1
suffices to express all such Gram matrices. The value BasicSDP(I) is the maximum of this
relaxation. No higher-round consistency or other strengthening is added.

Repeated positions refer to the same beta(v), not independently sampled copies. Even when S_e=S_e',
the distributions mu_e and mu_e' are separate: they must agree with the shared vectors on the
specified singleton and pairwise marginals, but are not required to agree on their entire joint
distributions. This convention fixes the relaxation even for duplicate scopes.

RATIO THRESHOLD. Use the reward-ratio convention, in which larger ratios are better, and define the
real constant

alpha_Gamma = inf { OPT(I)/BasicSDP(I) : I is an instance over Gamma and BasicSDP(I)>0 }.

Set alpha_Gamma=1 if this set is empty, in particular when all allowed predicates are identically
false. Zero-SDP instances are excluded from the quotient; their objective does not create a
division-by-zero convention. This constant lies in [0,1]. It is a threshold: the problem does not
require exact attainment by a single rounding algorithm or a uniform algorithm for computing
alpha_Gamma.

ASSERTION TO ESTABLISH. For every fixed D,Gamma as above and every fixed rational number r with

alpha_Gamma < r < 1,

there exist rational constants s,c with

0 <= s < c < 1 and s < r c,

such that the following promise problem is NP-hard under deterministic polynomial-time many-one
reductions from Boolean satisfiability:

YES: OPT(I) >= c;
NO: OPT(I) <= s.

A reduction must map every satisfiable Boolean formula into the YES set and every unsatisfiable
formula into the NO set, using only instances of this same fixed Gamma and the stated weight
encoding. Behavior outside the two promised sets is unrestricted. The reduction, its polynomial
bound, and c,s may depend on D,Gamma,r; they are fixed before the input formula size grows.

This is a single worst-case multiplicative-ratio assertion. It does not require hardness at every
point of an SDP approximation curve, for every SDP-gap witness, or with perfect completeness c=1.
The strict slack in r and the existence of some separated constants c,s are intentional. For
alpha_Gamma=1 there is no r in the stated interval and no hardness claim is required. If
alpha_Gamma<1, an exact polynomial-time optimizer would also achieve every r<1, so a separate
endpoint assertion for r=1 is unnecessary.

COMPLEXITY INTERPRETATION. Such a gap reduction excludes, under P != NP, a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm that returns an assignment of value at least r OPT(I) on every instance:
YES instances would yield a verifiable value above s and NO instances could not. No claim excluding
bounded-error randomized approximation algorithms follows here from P != NP alone, and no stronger
randomized-complexity hypothesis is silently imposed.

A complete affirmative resolution establishes the displayed NP-hardness statement for every fixed
language and every indicated r. A complete negative resolution rigorously refutes that universal
hardness assertion under the stated P != NP interpretation. For example, a fixed language together
with a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm and a proved guarantee val_I(a)>=beta OPT(I) for all
its instances, for some constant beta>alpha_Gamma, would suffice under P != NP. A resolution is not
required to prove the assumed separation P != NP itself. Failure of one rounding rule or one
attempted reduction is not a negative resolution. No proof or candidate algorithm is supplied here.

1 From the BasicSDP threshold to projection leakage

The assistant first checks whether repeated variables or occurrence-specific local distributions weaken
the relaxation enough to admit a counterexample. The assistant finds no apparent escape through
those conventions in Raghavendra’s optimal CSP approximation theorem [50]. Its dependence on the
Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) instead motivates a proposed converse. Alphabet-dependent round-
ing bounds for Unique Games [17] constrain one attempted baseline construction; the finite-valued CSP

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

dichotomy [55] also gives the assistant no tractable-language loophole.

The key distinction is between a small soundness/completeness ratio and completeness near one. The
assistant observes that the Khot–Minzer–Safra 2-to-2 Games theorem [39] does not directly supply the
latter. The assistant first considers the Goemans–Williamson near-satisfiable Max-Cut guarantee [29]
and the odd-cycle obstruction to strong repetition [52]. A baseline gadget then adds three dummy
labels, guaranteeing value at least 𝑇 = 1/3 while retaining a Khot–Vishnoi SDP gap [38]. If the universal
assertion forces hardness close to this baseline, the assistant argues that completeness must approach
one:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Wait insight: baseline T constant and hardness YES near1 NO ≤T+o(1) is already enough for UGC via
parallel repetition! NO needs val bounded from1, not tiny, then repeat constant power depending δ
alphabet.

The assistant invokes Rao’s alphabet-independent projection-game repetition bound [51], leaving quan-
titative parameters as a further step in the proposed equivalence. For an algorithmic alternative, the as-
sistant recalls constant-round sum-of-squares treatment of noisy-cube gaps [7] and contrasts the Arora–
Barak–Steurer subexponential algorithm [1] with the desired polynomial running time. Results for certi-
fied small-set expanders and globally hypercontractive graphs [5, 4] prompt the objection that arbitrary
constraint graphs need not satisfy those assumptions. It considers extending Trevisan’s spectral partial-
assignment method [56] and uses the Khot–Kindler–Mossel–O’Donnell reduction [40] to motivate an
aﬀine-game approach, while questioning the precise field formulation. Hashing and coordinatewise
Boolean recovery encounter accumulating errors or inconsistent cluster shifts.

Attention then turns to hardness gadgets. The Rich 2-to-1 equivalence [16] suggests hiding the match-
ing structure. The assistant examines the Dinur–Khot–Kindler–Minzer–Safra composition [21] and
Minzer–Zheng’s alphabet–soundness tradeoff [46] as possible outer constructions, and invokes Hås-
tad’s near-one versus one-half parity-equation hardness [32]. Using the shortcode framework of Khot–
Minzer–Safra and Barak–Kothari–Steurer [39, 8], the assistant explores a matrix test and a tensor exten-
sion whose honest acceptance can rise from one-half to three-quarters. Yet projected tensor queries can
reveal the outer constraint: an answer may adapt to that constraint instead of encoding a fixed label. Re-
stricting monomials to individual blocks and using sparse noise fails to hide recognizable duplications:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Thus at most one informative i. So cheater chooses arbitrary g_{v_i}, on exact duplicated input
matches and passes, independent of actual satisfiability!

Dense noise obstructs this response but loses the desired completeness. The assistant therefore retains
the proposed Unique Games route while turning to the problem of hiding projections without sacrificing
completeness.

2 Hidden structure and the search for a stability gap

The proposed Unique Games route to the original BasicSDP-threshold assertion repeatedly confronts
one requirement: honest assignment encodings must survive perturbations much better than arbitrary
answers. Tensor products make honest errors rare, but low-rank representations reveal projected coordi-
nates or recoverable constants. A prover can exploit that information without decoding an assignment.
Availability flags for selecting successful constraints also encounter a counting obstruction from unique-
ness. These attempts repeatedly return to the aﬀine 2-to-2 and inverse-shortcode framework [39, 8].

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

After considering Khot and Moshkovitz’s real-code candidate route [41], the assistant turns to Sub-
spaces Near-Intersection in Eldan and Moshkovitz’s Reduction From Non-Unique Games To Boolean Unique
Games as an alternative starting point [25]. Gaussian queries offer small geometric perturbations, but
nonlinear Lipschitz responses can be similarly stable:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

So stability comparable to honest. Thus noise-based Gaussian tester fails because low-degree linear
dependence not enforced; need linearity test via rank-one transformations that preserves F_x more
than smooth functions.
Compressed tensors with independent linear masks then offer a possible repair. Fourier eigenvalues
suggest how rank-one frequencies might encode assignments, but the assistant cannot yet establish con-
sistency across projected questions. The assistant consults Minzer and Zheng’s Near Optimal Alphabet-
Soundness Tradeoff PCPs for its composed construction and subspace identifications [46]. A BLR-style
linearity step is proposed to extract aligned labels [13]. It also considers Friedgut’s junta theorem for
extracting a small set of relevant coordinates, but finds that sparse-noise control does not constrain the
singular padded inputs used by projection tests [28].

An amplification insight changes the target: if undesirable frequencies lose increasingly more than
honest encodings per step, repeated noise might create constant dishonest loss while honest loss van-
ishes. The assistant does not find a suitable higher-degree walk. Recoverable components defeat mask-
ing, and majority blocks are less stable than competing dictators under sparse noise. The Kasami–
Tokura low-weight Reed–Muller classification guides a search for structured, highly biased multilinear
forms [36]. A more abstract equivariant-decoder proposal would still need inverse-shortcode decoding
and adaptation of the Dinur–Khot–Kindler–Minzer–Safra outer construction [21].

The assistant also sketches a conditional connection between the BasicSDP threshold and UGC, us-
ing the Khot–Vishnoi construction [38] and Raghavendra-style dictatorship tests [50]. The gap calcu-
lation uses Bonami–Beckner hypercontractivity [14, 12]; Rao and Dinur–Steurer projection-game rep-
etition are considered for alphabet-independent amplification [51, 22]. For the dictatorship-test trans-
fer, the assistant invokes the low-influence multilinear invariance principle of Mossel, O’Donnell and
Oleszkiewicz [47].

A final proposal uses rounding on a long cyclic group ℤ𝑀: small increments rarely cross interval
boundaries. The assistant considers Khot and Moshkovitz’s hardness result for real linear equations
as a possible starting point [42]. Exact integer equations appear to improve projection hiding, while
incompatible winding numbers on local tori might force cheating functions to lose stability. The assistant
identifies a diﬀiculty with smoothing: it may leave exceptional regions where outputs cease to be circle-
valued. It leaves extracting winding numbers and controlling correlated strategies as the next obstacles
to obtaining the desired completeness–soundness separation.

3 From winding obstructions to global consistency

The proposed Unique Games route toward the BasicSDP threshold encounters a recurring problem:
local consistency does not supply one global labeling. A cyclic construction based on scalar winding
appears vulnerable to vector-valued maps into higher-dimensional spheres. Tensoring these maps and
projecting through a shared Gaussian could correlate their singularities and achieve the honest strategy’s
error scale. The assistant considers this a possible failure mechanism for the cyclic construction.

The assistant therefore explores an algorithmic alternative for nearly satisfiable aﬀine Unique Games,
with constraints 𝑥𝑢 + 𝑥𝑣 = 𝑐𝑒 over 𝔽ℓ
2. The desired approximation must remain useful as the alpha-
bet grows. The assistant invokes the Khot–Vishnoi noisy-cube construction [38] against a universal
equivariant rounding map. Separately solving Boolean character projections by Goemans–Williamson

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

rounding [29] leaves their errors unsynchronized; graph squaring compounds error instead of elimi-
nating it. The conditional hardness route continues to use Raghavendra’s framework [50] and Rao’s
alphabet-independent projection-game repetition [51].

The assistant also recalls Khot–Saket hierarchy gaps [43] while assessing stronger relaxations. The
algorithmic search contrasts parity and random-CSP hierarchy lower bounds associated with Grigoriev
and Schoenebeck [31, 54] with the sum-of-squares hypercontractive refutation of noisy-cube and short-
code gaps [7]. Algorithms for Unique Games on expanders [2] and the subexponential algorithm of
Arora, Barak and Steurer [1] motivate graph decomposition, while the condition-and-round method
for certified small-set expanders [5] motivates a collision potential for differences of two pseudolabel-
ings. The assistant does not obtain the desired alphabet-uniform rounding from these approaches.

Alpha-expansion graph cuts [15] encounter the unknown gauge of shifted Potts constraints.
Connection-Laplacian Cheeger inequalities [6] suggest partial synchronization, but continuous
rotations still need conversion into discrete group labels. A separate proposed hardness route would
combine a hypothetical stable coloring with the Khot–Minzer–Safra inverse framework [39]; the
assistant leaves the coloring construction unresolved.

Shared error locations suggest interleaved-code decoding, but syndrome rank can remain small while
the number of errors grows. Another proposal geometrically separates bad edges while charging pro-
gressively smaller costs to good edges.

Its embedding, however, depends on the unknown true labels. The assistant considers Papadimitriou–
Yannakakis expander degree reduction [49], splitting variables into copies joined by equality constraints.
Forest compression then suggests reducing the task to finding linearly many compatible cycles beyond a
spanning forest. The assistant leaves both that solver and the required deterministic sampling argument
unresolved, and uses high-girth examples to examine limitations of local algorithms.

Barto and Kozik’s robust satisfiability theorem [11] offers a fixed-language comparison, but the assis-
tant questions whether the relevant constants can be made alphabet independent. Orthogonal separa-
tors [19] similarly expose alphabet-dependent losses in the proposed collision-based clusters. The as-
sistant also considers using Barak–Kelner–Steurer sum-of-squares rounding [9] to extract a high-norm
moment matrix, then encounters dimension-dependent conditioning costs. A more concrete attempt
conditions semidefinite pseudolabels on random linear-hash fibers. Surviving residuals seem less fre-
quent, but the restricted vectors no longer sum to a common reference vector:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Missing mass could be filled, but to shrink p need *renormalize* near intersection and **realign**
\(u'_0(v)\).

Repairing this defect may restore the discarded error. Holenstein’s correlated sampling [33] offers a
coupling of fiber-conditioned labels, but its mismatch cost also threatens the proposed error reduction.
Finally, countably many approximately consistent character projections do not ensure a coherent mea-
surable labeling: their common kernel and dependence on the selected lift remain obstacles. BLR linear-
ity testing [13] would decode jointly additive scalar potentials, but the assistant has not obtained that
joint coherence. The assistant ends this exploration with the global consistency obstacles unresolved
and continues searching for an alphabet-independent algorithm or a route to the BasicSDP threshold.

4 Nonlinear decoders and the amplification barrier

The attempt to match the BasicSDP threshold for unconditional hardness continued through a proposed
Unique Games reduction. Honest encodings needed to withstand noise while inconsistent answers be-
came decodable or unstable. Tensor constructions made honest error exponentially small by using rare
gates, but the same gates protected arbitrary functions of a surviving matrix channel:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Thus soundness gap ≈ε, not enough. Need ensure dummy axes themselves hard so no arbitrary gating.
Imbalanced cycle obstacle.

Reconsidering the Khot–Minzer–Safra construction [39] focused attention on representations
compatible with many projections and noise that disrupts adaptive choices among them. The assistant
revisited the outer reduction of Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra [21] and Minzer–Zheng’s
equivalence-class construction [46], and inspected the Barak–Kothari–Steurer shortcode formula-
tion [8]. Rich pairings [16] suggested scrambling labels, but fixed permutations preserved the
obstruction and edge-dependent permutations exposed it. Smooth-code alternatives prompted an
analogy with Khot–Moshkovitz’s Boolean noise test [41]; Gowers–Hatami stability [30] was another
comparison, without a demonstrated application to the proposed nonuniform directions. Nonlinear
equivariant decoders became the main alternative. The target was an unbounded separation between
nonlinear stability and the best compatible linear decoding, suﬀicient for the proposed reduction.

Two diﬀiculties then evolved together. Projection aliases Fourier frequencies, so low rank need not
yield agreeing decoded labels. A proposed inclusion–exclusion formula bounded Fourier truncation
independently of the number of outer coordinates, but controlling projected queries and extracting con-
sistent labels remained unresolved. Meanwhile, concatenating nonlinear decoders allowed linear com-
petitors to split into separate scalar lifts. Recalled Grassmann hypercontractivity of Ellis, Kindler and
Lifshitz [26] motivated seeking stronger rank bounds. Dinur’s gap amplification [23] suggested exploit-
ing structured completeness errors; Dumer–Micciancio–Sudan code-distance hardness [24] suggested
sparse outer solutions. Neither idea removed the projection obstacle, which the assistant contrasted
with the uniform query marginals in Håstad’s Max3Lin reduction [32]. Generic OR amplification en-
countered equality’s transitivity, and sparse-column encodings exposed their projections through du-
plicated entries.

Perfect colorings suggested decoders whose output characters occupy a single Fourier degree. The
Nisan–Szegedy degree bound [48] limited the number of relevant Boolean coordinates, prompting a
distinction between Boolean degree and degree over larger alphabets. Writing 𝑝 for nonlinear noise
failure and ℎ(𝑟) for the least noise cost of simultaneous linear lifts of 𝑟 independent logical characters,
the desired advantage was a growing ratio ℎ(𝑟)/𝑝. A simplex-mixing proposal sought to combine small
decoders through symmetric injections into a larger logical space, preserving an existing advantage
while enlarging the output. Recursive amplification again met fragmentation:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

But after many levels rank may collapse along branches; fixed b implies stabilization at factor≤b.
Need increasing b or avoid collapse via mixing outer layers.

Symmetry-based sections still admitted componentwise cheating, while permutation-valued path en-
codings could reveal projection pairings through a single comparison. The assistant retained simplex
mixing as a way to preserve an existing advantage, while continuing to seek amplification and a sound-
ness argument that would turn the decoder separation into the requested BasicSDP hardness reduction.
combine the Khot–Vishnoi gap [38] with
Raghavendra’s dictatorship-test framework [50] and the Mossel–O’Donnell–Oleszkiewicz invariance
principle [47], using Rao’s or Dinur–Steurer’s alphabet-independent repetition [51, 22] for the reverse
implication to Unique Games. Its algorithmic alternative recalled the condition-and-round approach of
Bafna and collaborators [5], while continuing to confront the small-set expansion barrier.

The assistant also retained a conditional fallback:

5 From coordinated-error barriers to a candidate decoder gap

The assistant revisited Raghavendra’s conditional CSP theorem and the Khot–Vishnoi gap [50, 38], and
considered improving Goemans–Williamson rounding as an algorithmic alternative [29]. Tensoring
nonlinear decoders spread errors across logical coordinates, defeating amplification.

Comparisons with Ellis–Keller–Lifshitz edge-isoperimetric stability [27] and Gowers–Hatami stabil-
ity of approximate representations [30] did not yield the desired decoder. Graphical encodings offered
local consistency but required exponentially many Fourier queries. Håstad’s parity gap [32] and Rao’s
repetition [51] supplied a proposed hardness route. The assistant questioned expander links against
Bafna and collaborators’ sum-of-squares algorithms [5]. It also noted that one label determines a con-
nected perfectly satisfied unique-game component.

To coordinate scalar errors in nearly satisfiable aﬀine games, it considered combining Goemans–
Williamson rounding with Blum–Luby–Rubinfeld linearity testing [29, 13]. Random hashing invoked
Charikar–Makarychev–Makarychev’s smaller-alphabet guarantee [17], but incompatible projected
solutions prevented a geometric-progress argument. It contrasted polynomial time with Arora–Barak–
Steurer’s subexponential algorithm and questioned the hierarchy strength of Khot–Saket gaps [1, 43].
Its proposed use of Karger’s cut-counting bound involved a potentially unbounded approximation
factor [35]; Friedgut’s cube junta theorem lacked the needed general-graph analogue [28].

Independently controlled transposition words failed to generate the required transitive period action.
Barrington’s theorem suggested both an expressivity obstruction and an escape through repeated con-
trol bits [10].

The assistant considered Croot–Lev–Pach polynomial methods and Lovett’s analytic-rank work, but

found its contemplated inverse-rank estimate too weak [20, 45]. It then set 𝑋 = 𝐾 = 𝔽3

𝑞, 𝑞 = 2𝑑, and

𝐶(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑦 + (𝑥2𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥2).
It compared nonlinear error 𝑝 with compatible linear-decoder error ℎ, arguing that cubic monomials
and finite-field specialization bound exceptional cancellations by 3𝑟 for rank-𝑟 observable families. Con-
catenating through all binary-linear isomorphisms randomized observable subspaces while enforcing
a common parent lift. The assistant argued that its harmonic-potential estimate kept ℎ ≥ 1/4 while 𝑝
vanished; the assistant checked specialization and conditioning.

To convert this separation into polynomial-size hardness, it returned to Khot–Minzer–Safra sound-
ness through Barak–Kothari–Steurer [39, 8], the Dinur–Khot–Kindler–Minzer–Safra agreement frame-
work and its smoothness/query-size obstacle [21], and Minzer–Zheng’s Near Optimal Alphabet-Soundness
Tradeoff PCPs [46]. Outer-PCP composition remained its next task.

6 Shared aﬀine tables and frequent decoding advice

The original BasicSDP threshold problem now motivates a proposed route through Unique Games hard-
ness. The assistant combines its nonlinear encoding with shared aﬀine tables, then develops a transfer
to finite constraint languages.

The encoding seeks an equivariant decoder on a binary space containing 𝐾 = 𝔽ℓ

2: carefully chosen
noise should rarely change the decoded value, while every suﬀiciently high-rank family of linear char-
acters detects it with constant probability. Concatenated quadratic constructions and a harmonic rank
potential are offered to establish this separation.

The assistant studies subspace identifications in Minzer–Zheng’s PCP construction [46] and clique
folding in the Dinur–Khot–Kindler–Minzer–Safra reduction [21]. The proposed reduction replaces ap-
proximate consistency checks by exact identification of tables with the same reduced support. This mat-
ters because consistency errors could otherwise concentrate on the small slices used by the published

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

8

shortcode soundness results of Khot–Minzer–Safra and Barak–Kothari–Steurer [39, 8]. Conditional
agreement suggests decoding an aﬀine class rather than enumerating individual candidates. Fourier
sampling is proposed to recover a compatible projected label.

A further obstacle is that existence of one favorable slice does not guarantee useful random advice:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Existence tiny row fiber via theorem not enough because advice U gets random A,S=AM. Need positive
probability independent k of hitting a whole fiber.

The proposed repair randomizes the union of favorable row fibers and argues that too little total measure
would contradict shortcode soundness. Starting from Håstad’s parity-equation hardness theorem [32],
sparse projections and coordinates with zero advice slopes are intended to expose repeated equation-
versus-variable games.

For BasicSDP, the assistant uses Raghavendra’s dictatorship-test framework [50]: smoothing and
Gaussian comparison aim to bound low-influence test performance by the integral optimum; influen-
tial coordinates instead decode the outer game. It develops a direct Lindeberg comparison instead of
invoking the Mossel–O’Donnell–Oleszkiewicz invariance theorem [47]. The assistant identifies two
remaining concerns: repeated variables may obstruct the intended projection-game formulation, and
ordinary Raz repetition [53] introduces an alphabet dependence that risks circular parameter choices.
Alphabet-independent projection-game repetition from Rao and Dinur–Steurer [51, 22] is checked as a
remedy.

The assistant also compares the proposed parameters with the alphabet-dependent guarantees of
Charikar–Makarychev–Makarychev [17], finding no contradiction in that comparison. It revisits a fall-
back converse based on the Khot–Vishnoi integrality gap [38], extended with dummy labels to force a
baseline objective value.

7 Uniformity in rectangular shortcode parameters

Combining the nonlinear gadget with Unique Games decoding requires bounds that remain uniform as
the outer construction grows.

The assistant asks whether translation constraints over 𝔽ℓ

2 admit an algorithmic obstruction. It revisits
Khot’s Unique Games formulation [44] and recalls the Max-2-Lin hardness results of Khot–Kindler–
Mossel–O’Donnell [40], while questioning their relevance to this particular group. Coordinatewise
Goemans–Williamson rounding [29] incurs a union-bound loss in ℓ; the alphabet dependence in the
Charikar–Makarychev–Makarychev algorithms [17] also enters the comparison. The entangled-prover
result Unique Games with Entangled Provers are Easy [37] does not directly give an algorithm for the clas-
sical game.

The gadget has an equivariant decoder 𝐶 ∶ 𝒱 → 𝐾: shifting its input by 𝑘 ∈ 𝐾 shifts its output by
𝑘. Proposed noise almost preserves this nonlinear decoder while remaining detectable by suﬀiciently
large families of linear characters. A finite-field quadratic map, a bound of 3𝑟 simultaneous alignments
for generic rank-𝑟 character spaces, and concatenation tracked by a harmonic potential are used by the
assistant to argue for the separation. The assistant checks why specialization cannot increase matrix
rank:
VERBATIM EXCERPT

Matrix rank cannot rise under specialization because all larger minors zero *as polynomials*, even
with rational combinations; rank over function field r implies determinants identically zero in
F2[x]. yes. Good.

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

The assistant uses the Khot–Vishnoi integrality gap [38] to check simple SDP rounding objections. It
invokes the Khot–Minzer–Safra inverse result [39], consulted through Barak–Kothari–Steurer’s short-
code formulation [8]. It scrutinizes whether the constants remain uniform for the construction’s highly
rectangular matrices and provisionally accepts that they do.

For soundness, the assistant uses Håstad’s parity-equation hardness theorem [32] and checks
a cloning modification to make the three variables within each equation distinct. Ordered local
copies preserve compatibility without merging repeated variable positions across blocks.
It credits
Minzer–Zheng [46] for the smooth variable-versus-equation game with advice that informs its sparse-
projection construction. Sparse singleton projections, with probability 𝛽 = 𝑘−2/3, are intended both to
make distributional error vanish and to leave increasingly many coordinates available for decoding.
Fourier agreement, bounded row and column advice, and projection-game repetition must then rule
out cheating. The assistant notes that conditioning on successful witnesses would compromise the
independence needed for decoding. To avoid circular parameter choices, the assistant compares the
alphabet-dependent repetition bounds of Raz and Holenstein [53, 33] with the alphabet-independent
projection-game bounds of Rao and Dinur–Steurer [51, 22].

The BasicSDP transfer follows Raghavendra’s framework [50], using shared answers for repeated
variables, smoothing, low-influence Gaussian comparison based on pair moments, and influential-
coordinate decoding. Rational approximations require reserved slack.

8 Row-fiber abundance and threshold transfer

The next issue is whether useful decoding advice occurs with constant probability. The proposed argu-
ment invokes Håstad’s parity-equation hardness result [32], the Khot–Minzer–Safra shortcode theorem
in the Barak–Kothari–Steurer formulation [39, 8], and projection-game parallel repetition [51, 22]; their
applicability depends on the uniformity and conditioning requirements below.

The proposed gadget separates a shift-equivariant nonlinear map’s small noise sensitivity from con-
stant detection by suﬀiciently high-rank linear observables. Its quadratic seed, 𝑄(𝑥) = (𝑥2𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥2),
operates over a characteristic-two field. A polynomial anti-alignment argument and harmonic rank-loss
potential were intended to amplify that separation. The argument must account for random orienta-
tions, quotient shifts, and possible representations of nonlinear derivatives by mixtures of linear maps
before controlling the frequency of useful decoding advice.

Soundness exposed a sharper issue: the shortcode theorem’s existence of a correlated slice did not

immediately make useful row advice suﬀiciently frequent.

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Row fiber abundance lemma is important to avoid conditioned advice rare due row values S0
exponential m. KMS just existence of one fiber, probability 2^{-m r}. Need union randomization
argument ensure many.

The proposed repair randomized the union of good row fibers to argue abundance by contradiction.
Another correction made the goodness probability explicitly averaged over questions, rather than valid
for each question. The sparse-projection and matrix-advice construction drew on the smooth variable-
versus-equation game with advice of Minzer and Zheng [46]. The assistant argues that sparse projection
at rate 𝛽 = 𝑘−2/3 gives vanishing distributional error while retaining many coordinates with zero advice
slopes. Applying parallel repetition then depended on those hidden coordinates remaining independent
under public conditioning. For this fixed-alphabet outer game, the assistant also considered the general
repetition theorems of Raz and Holenstein [53, 33]; alphabet-independent amplification remained the
role of Rao or Dinur–Steurer [51, 22].

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

The BasicSDP transfer followed Raghavendra’s dictatorship-test framework [50] and used a finite gap
instance with integral optimum 𝐴∗, feasible SDP value 𝐵∗, and 𝐴∗/𝐵∗ < 𝑟. Smoothing, Fourier trun-
cation, and Gaussian replacement were intended to bound low-influence acceptance by 𝐴∗; influential
coordinates supplied candidate Unique Games labels. Parameter ordering and rational approximation
also received scrutiny. For comparison, the assistant considered applying Goemans–Williamson round-
ing separately to binary coordinates [29]; its union-bound estimate accumulated a factor equal to the
number of coordinates, so this did not supply the desired alphabet-independent obstruction.

9 Scalar detection and conditional independence

The relation between scalar noise cost and simultaneous linear decoding becomes the next obstacle. The
proposed reduction continues to use Håstad’s parity-equation gap [32], the Khot–Minzer–Safra inverse
shortcode result [39] through Barak–Kothari–Steurer’s Small-Set Expansion in Shortcode Graph and the 2-to-
2 Conjecture [8], projection-game parallel repetition [22], and Raghavendra’s BasicSDP framework [50].
In checking that the starting gap reduction remains deterministic and polynomial for fixed parameters,
it invokes the PCP constructions of Dinur [23] and Arora–Safra [3].

The gadget seeks a perturbation that rarely changes an equivariant nonlinear encoding but remains
detectable by high-rank linear observations. The algebraic argument identifies which monomial evalua-
tions generate a function space; the recursive argument seeks to control exceptional rank losses through
a harmonic estimate. Searching for an obstruction, the assistant observes:

VERBATIM EXCERPT

Aha! We don't actually need simultaneous union per z; detection prob for subspace G equals \(2\)
times average over its characters of scalar nonzero probability (because for each a with some g≠0,
exactly half of linear subspace maps a to1).

The assistant thus reformulates the possible contradiction through average scalar cost, but still needs
compatible linear extensions to complete this obstruction to the nonlinear separation. It also tests the
gadget against the Kahn–Kalai–Linial influence theorem [34]: small average influence across an enor-
mous number of leaves does not give the sought contradiction. Comparing binary translation games
with the Goemans–Williamson near-satisfiable Max-Cut guarantee [29] likewise leaves the diﬀiculty of
controlling simultaneous errors across all label coordinates.

The smooth variable-versus-equation game with advice in Minzer–Zheng [46] supplies the inspira-
tion for sparse projections and zero-advice coordinates. Decoding imposes two consistency require-
ments. Shared aﬀine tables must choose translation representatives from their reduced keys alone. Also,
bounded row information must live in the fixed output dimension, while column witnesses may be se-
lected using the equation prover’s information; blindly guessing directions in a growing domain would
destroy a constant decoding probability. The assistant argues that sparse projection with probability
𝛽 = 𝑘−2/3 makes advice distributions close while leaving increasingly many coordinates with zero ad-
vice slopes. Conditional independence on those coordinates remains essential to the repetition argu-
ment. The assistant considers Raz’s general repetition theorem [53] for the fixed-alphabet clean game,
while using the alphabet-independent projection-game bounds of Rao and Dinur–Steurer [51, 22] for
the final amplification.

An alternative amplification using several perturbations is explored and left unused. The retained
BasicSDP transfer smooths and truncates functions, matches singleton and pair moments with Gaus-
sian variables, and requires one assignment across the gap instance and alphabet-independent influence
bounds.

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

10 Compatibility of labels and pair moments

Local decoding must yield compatible labels before the Unique Games gap can be transferred to a fixed
constraint language.

The central proposal separates nonlinear stability from linear detectability. A map 𝐶 ∶ 𝒱 → 𝐾 obeys
𝐶(𝑥 + 𝑘) = 𝐶(𝑥) + 𝑘; carefully chosen noise should rarely change 𝐶 while detecting every suﬀiciently
high-rank family of characters restricted to 𝐾. The recursive quadratic gadget uses

𝑄(𝑥) = (𝑥2𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥3, 𝑥1𝑥2),

𝑥 ∈ 𝔽 3
2𝑑.

A generic-subspace argument is intended to limit aligned characters, and a harmonic rank potential
should control extinction while nonlinear sensitivity decreases. Attempts to contradict this separation
through coordinatewise linear rounding encounter a diﬀiculty: separately corrected coordinates need
not remain in the required linear code.

The outer reduction starts with Håstad’s parity-triple hardness [32]. Sparse projections and matrix
advice follow the smooth-game idea discussed by Minzer and Zheng [46]. The assistant checks repeti-
tion on the clean coordinates using Raz’s theorem [53], and alphabet-independent amplification using
Rao or Dinur–Steurer [51, 22].

The proposed soundness bridge invokes the shortcode results of Khot–Minzer–Safra and Barak–
Kothari–Steurer [39, 8]. The proposed application decodes on bounded row and column slices and
transfers useful events by unconditional total-variation comparison. Folding should select valid aﬀine
answers; coordinates with zero advice should recover an ordinary repeated projection game. Repeated
variables retain separate local coordinates, a convention essential to the claimed independence.

The assistant also considers algorithms for Unique Games on expanding constraint graphs [2], but ar-
gues that its graph need not have the required expansion. It considers coordinatewise Boolean rounding
associated with Goemans–Williamson and Charikar–Wirth [29, 18]; a union bound over many coordi-
nates does not give the desired alphabet-independent guarantee. It compares translation-game exam-
ples from Khot–Vishnoi [38] with the proposed construction, distinguishing SDP stability from stability
of an actual labeling.

Finally, the transfer to the BasicSDP threshold in Raghavendra’s framework [50] is checked for
matched pair moments, Gaussian replacement after smoothing and truncation, and simplex projection
producing one globally consistent assignment across constraints. Rational weights and fixed-parameter
ordering are also revisited.

11 Parameter order and uniform slice bounds

The order of parameter choices is essential to the proposed route from Håstad’s parity-equation gap [32]
through a nonlinear noise gadget and Unique Games hardness to each fixed finite constraint language.
The gadget aims to make an equivariant decoder nearly invariant under noise while high-rank linear
observables detect that noise with constant probability. Rechecking the finite-field construction leads
through independence of square-root monomials, polynomial specialization, and a harmonic potential
controlling rank loss under recursive restrictions.

A concrete counterstrategy assigns fixed bits on small table supports and chooses satisfying local
answers elsewhere. The assistant argues that simultaneous perturbation directions impose incompatible
demands on unsatisfied equations, while uniform subspace noise obstructs concentrating on favorable
directions.

The assistant next checks a literature dependency: the shortcode result attributed to Khot–Minzer–
Safra through the Barak–Kothari–Steurer formulation [39, 8] must provide slice bounds independent of

BasicSDP threshold and Unique Games

12

a subsequently enlarged output dimension. Otherwise the row constraints might consume the kernel
needed for decoding. The assistant considers rectangular padding and projection as possible ways to
obtain the required uniform bounds.

The soundness audit draws on the smooth variable-versus-equation game with advice in Minzer and
Zheng’s Near Optimal Alphabet-Soundness Tradeoff PCPs [46], and examines whether zero advice slopes
conceal singleton projections. The assistant argues that with projection probability 𝛽 = 𝑘−2/3, distri-
butional disturbance vanishes while the number of usable repeated-game coordinates grows. Decoder
dependencies and parameter order are clarified. The assistant checks the alphabet-independent rep-
etition bounds of Rao and Dinur–Steurer [51, 22] for amplifying the resulting Unique Games gap; it
also notes that Raz’s theorem [53] suﬀices for the fixed-alphabet game on the clean coordinates. An
alternative amplification by summing perturbations remains unused because inconsistent loops require
additional control.

For comparison with known algorithms, it revisits the Khot–Vishnoi integrality gap [38]: the binary
translation structure of the constraints does not by itself supply a dimension-independent SDP rounding
argument.

Finally, the assistant checks the BasicSDP transfer in Raghavendra’s framework [50] through full-
support marginals, smoothing, Gaussian moment matching, and influence-list decoding. The dimen-
sion dependence of the imported shortcode bounds remains under examination.

12 Assembling the proposed reduction

The proposed reduction has two stages: first obtain Unique Games with nearly perfect completeness
and arbitrarily small soundness, then transfer that gap to the BasicSDP threshold for each fixed finite
constraint language.

The quadratic gadget is checked through a harmonic potential measuring surviving character rank.
A key local observation is that nongeneric character spaces need only have small constant probability:
fresh outgoing randomness supplies a further factor proportional to the loss parameter. This step also
requires trace duality, character alignment, and conditional uniformity of gadget outputs.

The assistant uses the inverse-shortcode results of Khot–Minzer–Safra and the Barak–Kothari–Steurer
formulation [39, 8]. It explains an equality-test consequence through value fibers and justifies dimension
padding by projecting aﬀine tensor-product slices.

The parity-triple reduction starts from Håstad’s nearly satisfiable parity-equation hardness
theorem [32]. The assistant credits Minzer and Zheng’s PCP construction as inspiration for the
variable-versus-equation game with advice [46].
Its proposed soundness analysis compares gadget
noise with uniform rank-one noise, then seeks aﬀine structure on bounded row-and-column slices.
Its parameter order fixes gadget and advice dimensions before increasing the number 𝑘 of parity
blocks. Sparse projection with 𝛽 = 𝑘−2/3 is intended to make 𝑘𝛽2 → 0 while 𝑘𝛽 → ∞, simultaneously
suppressing distributional error and producing many clean singleton blocks. Uniform bounds and
alphabet-independent projection-game repetition, supplied by Rao or Dinur–Steurer, are essential
dependencies [51, 22]. The assistant also considers an alternative amplification using Raz’s theorem on
a small base game, but retains the projection-game route [53].

Finally, using Raghavendra’s SDP and dictatorship-test framework, the assistant transfers a fixed-
language SDP gap witness through a smoothed dictatorship test, low-influence replacement, list de-
coding, and rational sampling weights [50]. It also compares the claimed threshold with Goemans–
Williamson approximation for Max-Cut and finds no contradiction [29].

The assistant concludes with its proposed aﬀirmative argument for the Unique Games consequence

and the BasicSDP threshold claim.
